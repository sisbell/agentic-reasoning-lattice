# ASN-0085: V-Position Ordinal Decomposition

*2026-04-11*

The strand model (ASN-0036) defines V-positions as element-field tumblers whose first component is the subspace identifier (subspace(v) = v₁), and the ordinal-only formulation of TA7a (ASN-0034) establishes that within-subspace arithmetic passes only the ordinal to the operations while holding the subspace identifier as structural context. This ASN extends the strand model with the concrete extraction and reconstruction functions that formalize this decomposition: separating a V-position into its subspace identifier and its within-subspace ordinal, reconstructing a V-position from these components, and projecting a displacement onto its ordinal component. We then establish the central property: tumbler addition commutes with the decomposition, and derive from this that TA7a's closure guarantees on S govern the S-membership of the result.


## Ordinal Extraction

We frequently need to separate a V-position into its subspace identifier and its ordinal within that subspace. Per the ordinal-only formulation of TA7a (ASN-0034), we define the extraction and reconstruction functions.

**ord(v)** — *OrdinalExtraction* (DEF, function). For a V-position v with #v = m and subspace(v) = v₁, the *ordinal* is:

`ord(v) = [v₂, ..., vₘ]`

— the tumbler of length m − 1 obtained by stripping the subspace identifier. When v satisfies S8a, every component of v is positive, so every component of [v₂, ..., vₘ] is positive — placing ord(v) in TA7a's domain S = {o ∈ T : #o ≥ 1 ∧ (A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #o : oᵢ > 0)}.

*Formal Contract:*
- *Preconditions:* `v ∈ T`, `#v ≥ 2`.
- *Definition:* `ord(v) = [v₂, ..., vₘ]` where `m = #v`.
- *Postconditions:* `ord(v) ∈ T` (length `m - 1 ≥ 1`, satisfying T0). `#ord(v) = #v - 1`. When `v` satisfies S8a (`zeros(v) = 0 ∧ v₁ ≥ 1 ∧ v > 0`), `ord(v) ∈ S` — every component of `[v₂, ..., vₘ]` is positive since every component of `v` is positive by S8a.
- *Frame:* Pure function on the component sequence of `v` — no state is read or modified.

**vpos(S, o)** — *VPositionReconstruction* (DEF, function). For subspace identifier S and ordinal o = [o₁, ..., oₖ]:

`vpos(S, o) = [S, o₁, ..., oₖ]`

with #vpos(S, o) = k + 1. These are inverses: ord(vpos(S, o)) = o and vpos(subspace(v), ord(v)) = v.

*Formal Contract:*
- *Preconditions:* `S ∈ ℕ`, `o ∈ T`, `#o ≥ 1`.
- *Definition:* `vpos(S, o) = [S, o₁, ..., oₖ]` where `k = #o`.
- *Postconditions:* `vpos(S, o) ∈ T`, `#vpos(S, o) = #o + 1`, `vpos(S, o)₁ = S`. (a) `ord(vpos(S, o)) = o` — since `vpos(S, o) = [S, o₁, ..., oₖ]`, stripping the first component recovers `[o₁, ..., oₖ] = o`. (b) For any `v ∈ T` with `#v ≥ 2`: `vpos(subspace(v), ord(v)) = v` — since `subspace(v) = v₁` and `ord(v) = [v₂, ..., vₘ]`, reconstruction gives `[v₁, v₂, ..., vₘ] = v`. Both inverse properties are pure sequence identities that hold unconditionally on T. When `S ≥ 1` and `(A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #o : oᵢ > 0)`, the result satisfies S8a: `zeros(vpos(S, o)) = 0` (S ≥ 1 and each oᵢ > 0, so no component is zero) and `vpos(S, o) > 0`.
- *Frame:* Pure function on `S` and the component sequence of `o` — no state is read or modified.

**w_ord** — *OrdinalDisplacementProjection* (DEF, function). For a displacement w with `w₁ = 0` and `#w = m ≥ 2`, the *ordinal projection* is:

`w_ord = [w₂, ..., wₘ]`

of length m − 1. The condition `w₁ = 0` is structurally necessary: it ensures `actionPoint(w) ≥ 2`, so by TumblerAdd all positions before the action point are copied from the operand — position 1 (the subspace identifier) is preserved by any addition `v ⊕ w`. This is the mechanism by which arithmetic stays within a subspace. At the restricted depth m = 2, w = [0, c] for positive integer c, and w_ord = [c].

*Formal Contract:*
- *Preconditions:* `w ∈ T`, `#w ≥ 2`, `w₁ = 0`.
- *Definition:* `w_ord = [w₂, ..., wₘ]` where `m = #w`.
- *Postconditions:* `w_ord ∈ T` (length `m - 1 ≥ 1`, satisfying T0). `#w_ord = #w - 1`. When `w > 0`, `w_ord > 0` — since `w₁ = 0`, positivity of `w` requires some `wᵢ > 0` with `i ≥ 2`, which appears in `w_ord`. When `w > 0`: `actionPoint(w_ord) = actionPoint(w) - 1`.
- *Frame:* Pure function on the component sequence of `w` — no state is read or modified.


## Arithmetic Homomorphism

The definitions above decompose V-positions into subspace context and ordinal operand. We now establish that the decomposition is structure-preserving: tumbler addition commutes with extraction. This is the property that makes the definitions more than naming conventions — it connects V-position arithmetic to TA7a's closure guarantees on S.

**OrdAddHom** — *OrdinalAdditionHomomorphism* (LEMMA). For a V-position `v` with `#v = m ≥ 2`, and a displacement `w` with `w₁ = 0`, `#w = m`, `w > 0`, and `actionPoint(w) ≤ m`:

`ord(v ⊕ w) = ord(v) ⊕ w_ord`

*Proof.* Let `k = actionPoint(w)`. Since `w₁ = 0`, we have `k ≥ 2`. By TumblerAdd, the result `r = v ⊕ w` is built component-wise in three regions:

- For `1 ≤ i < k`: `rᵢ = vᵢ` (copy from start).
- At `i = k`: `rₖ = vₖ + wₖ` (single-component advance).
- For `k < i ≤ m`: `rᵢ = wᵢ` (copy from displacement).

So `ord(v ⊕ w) = [r₂, ..., rₘ] = [v₂, ..., v_{k-1}, vₖ + wₖ, w_{k+1}, ..., wₘ]`.

For the right-hand side, `w_ord = [w₂, ..., wₘ]` has `actionPoint(w_ord) = k - 1`, since `(w_ord)ⱼ = w_{j+1}` and the first nonzero `w_{j+1}` occurs at `j + 1 = k`, i.e. `j = k - 1`. The application is well-defined: `actionPoint(w_ord) = k − 1 ≤ m − 1 = #ord(v)`, since `k ≤ m` by precondition. By TumblerAdd for `ord(v) ⊕ w_ord`:

- For `1 ≤ j < k-1`: `(ord(v) ⊕ w_ord)ⱼ = ord(v)ⱼ = v_{j+1}`.
- At `j = k-1`: `(ord(v) ⊕ w_ord)_{k-1} = ord(v)_{k-1} + (w_ord)_{k-1} = vₖ + wₖ`.
- For `k-1 < j ≤ m-1`: `(ord(v) ⊕ w_ord)ⱼ = (w_ord)ⱼ = w_{j+1}`.

So `ord(v) ⊕ w_ord = [v₂, ..., v_{k-1}, vₖ + wₖ, w_{k+1}, ..., wₘ]`.

The two sequences are identical component by component. ∎

*Instance (a).* Let `v = [1, 3, 5]`, `w = [0, 0, 2]` (action point 3). Then `v ⊕ w = [1, 3, 7]` and `ord([1, 3, 7]) = [3, 7]`. On the right, `ord(v) = [3, 5]` and `w_ord = [0, 2]`, giving `[3, 5] ⊕ [0, 2] = [3, 7]`. Both sides agree.

*Instance (b).* Let `v = [1, 3, 5]`, `w = [0, 4, 0]` (action point 2). Then `v ⊕ w = [1, 7, 0]` and `ord([1, 7, 0]) = [7, 0]`. On the right, `ord(v) = [3, 5]` and `w_ord = [4, 0]`, giving `[3, 5] ⊕ [4, 0] = [7, 0]`. Both sides agree. Note that `[7, 0] ∉ S` — the zero in the tail component after the action point places the result outside TA7a's domain S, illustrating the S-membership boundary.

*Formal Contract:*
- *Preconditions:* `v ∈ T`, `#v = m ≥ 2`; `w ∈ T`, `w > 0`, `#w = m`, `w₁ = 0`, `actionPoint(w) ≤ m`.
- *Postconditions:* (a) `ord(v ⊕ w) = ord(v) ⊕ w_ord`. (b) `subspace(v ⊕ w) = subspace(v)` — since `k ≥ 2`, TumblerAdd copies `r₁ = v₁` from the start, preserving the subspace identifier. (c) Full decomposition: `v ⊕ w = vpos(subspace(v), ord(v) ⊕ w_ord)` — let `r = v ⊕ w`; by TA0 `#r = #w = m ≥ 2`, so the generalized inverse (vpos contract (b)) applies to `r`: `vpos(subspace(r), ord(r)) = r`; substituting `subspace(r) = subspace(v)` from (b) and `ord(r) = ord(v) ⊕ w_ord` from (a) yields the result. Note that `ord(v) ⊕ w_ord` need not lie in S — the definition and inverse properties of vpos are pure sequence operations that hold for any `o ∈ T`.
- *Frame:* Both sides are computed from `v` and `w` alone — no state is consulted.

**OrdAddS8a** — *AdditionPreservesS8a* (LEMMA). For a V-position `v` satisfying S8a with `#v = m ≥ 2`, and a displacement `w` with `w₁ = 0`, `#w = m`, `w > 0`, and `actionPoint(w) ≤ m`: `v ⊕ w` satisfies S8a if and only if all components of `w_ord` after its action point are positive.

*Proof.* Let `r = v ⊕ w` with `k = actionPoint(w) ≥ 2`. By TumblerAdd, the components of `r` partition into three regions:

- `r₁ = v₁ ≥ 1` (by S8a on `v`, and `w₁ = 0` so `1 < k` and TumblerAdd copies from `v`).
- For `2 ≤ i < k`: `rᵢ = vᵢ ≥ 1` (by S8a on `v`).
- At `i = k`: `rₖ = vₖ + wₖ ≥ 1 + 1 = 2` (since `vₖ ≥ 1` by S8a and `wₖ ≥ 1` as the action-point component).
- For `k < i ≤ m`: `rᵢ = wᵢ` (copied from the displacement).

Components `r₁` through `rₖ` are unconditionally positive. S8a requires `zeros(r) = 0` and `r > 0`, which reduces to: every component is positive. The only components that can fail are `r_{k+1}, ..., r_m = w_{k+1}, ..., w_m` — exactly the tail components of `w`, which are the tail components of `w_ord` (since `(w_ord)_j = w_{j+1}` and the action point of `w_ord` is `k - 1`). Therefore:

`v ⊕ w satisfies S8a ⟺ (A i : k < i ≤ m : wᵢ > 0) ⟺ all tail components of w_ord are positive`

By OrdAddHom, `ord(v ⊕ w) = ord(v) ⊕ w_ord`, so equivalently `ord(v ⊕ w) ∈ S` under the same condition — the ordinal-domain S-membership and the V-position S8a property are two views of the same constraint on the displacement's tail. Instance (b) above confirms the boundary: `w_ord = [4, 0]` has a zero after the action point, and `v ⊕ w = [1, 7, 0]` fails S8a. ∎

*Formal Contract:*
- *Preconditions:* `v ∈ T` satisfying S8a, `#v = m ≥ 2`; `w ∈ T`, `w > 0`, `#w = m`, `w₁ = 0`, `actionPoint(w) ≤ m`.
- *Postconditions:* `v ⊕ w satisfies S8a ⟺ (A i : actionPoint(w) < i ≤ m : wᵢ > 0)`. Equivalently, `ord(v ⊕ w) ∈ S ⟺ v ⊕ w satisfies S8a`.

**OrdShiftHom** — *OrdinalShiftHomomorphism* (COROLLARY). For a V-position `v` with `#v = m ≥ 2` and `n ≥ 1`:

`ord(shift(v, n)) = shift(ord(v), n)`

Since `shift(v, n) = v ⊕ δ(n, m)` and `δ(n, m) = [0, ..., 0, n]` has `δ(n, m)₁ = 0`, OrdAddHom applies. The ordinal projection `(δ(n, m))_ord = [0, ..., 0, n]` of length `m - 1` is `δ(n, m-1)`. So `ord(v ⊕ δ(n, m)) = ord(v) ⊕ δ(n, m-1) = shift(ord(v), n)`. ∎

*Formal Contract:*
- *Preconditions:* `v ∈ T`, `#v = m ≥ 2`, `n ≥ 1`.
- *Postconditions:* `ord(shift(v, n)) = shift(ord(v), n)`. When `v` satisfies S8a, OrdAddS8a applies; since `δ(n, m) = [0, ..., 0, n]` has action point `m`, there are no tail components after the action point — the OrdAddS8a condition is vacuously satisfied. Therefore `shift(v, n)` unconditionally satisfies S8a when `v` does.
