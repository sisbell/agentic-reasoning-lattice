## V-position ordinal decomposition

S8a establishes V-positions as element-field tumblers whose first component is the subspace identifier (subspace(v) = v₁), and the ordinal-only formulation of TA7a (ASN-0034) establishes that within-subspace arithmetic passes only the ordinal to the operations while holding the subspace identifier as structural context. We now formalize this decomposition with concrete extraction and reconstruction functions: separating a V-position into its subspace identifier and its within-subspace ordinal, reconstructing a V-position from these components, and projecting a displacement onto its ordinal component. We then establish the central property: tumbler addition commutes with the decomposition, and derive from this that TA7a's closure guarantees on S govern the S-membership of the result.

**ord(v) (OrdinalExtraction).** For a V-position v with #v = m and subspace(v) = v₁, the *ordinal* is:

`ord(v) = [v₂, ..., vₘ]`

— the tumbler of length m − 1 obtained by stripping the subspace identifier. When v satisfies S8a, every component of v is positive, so every component of [v₂, ..., vₘ] is positive — placing ord(v) in TA7a's domain S = {o ∈ T : #o ≥ 1 ∧ (A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #o : oᵢ > 0)}.

*Formal Contract:*
- *Preconditions:* `v ∈ T`, `#v ≥ 2`.
- *Definition:* `ord(v) = [v₂, ..., vₘ]` where `m = #v`.
- *Postconditions:* `ord(v) ∈ T` (length `m - 1 ≥ 1`, satisfying T0). `#ord(v) = #v - 1`. When `v` satisfies S8a (`zeros(v) = 0 ∧ v₁ ≥ 1 ∧ v > 0`), `ord(v) ∈ S` — every component of `[v₂, ..., vₘ]` is positive since every component of `v` is positive by S8a.
- *Frame:* Pure function on the component sequence of `v` — no state is read or modified.
