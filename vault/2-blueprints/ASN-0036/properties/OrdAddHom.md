**OrdAddHom (OrdinalAdditionHomomorphism).** For a V-position `v` with `#v = m ≥ 2`, and a displacement `w` with `w₁ = 0`, `#w = m`, `w > 0`, and `actionPoint(w) ≤ m`:

`ord(v ⊕ w) = ord(v) ⊕ w_ord`

*Proof.* Let `k = actionPoint(w)`. Since `w₁ = 0`, we have `k ≥ 2`. By TumblerAdd, the result `r = v ⊕ w` is built component-wise in three regions:

- For `1 ≤ i < k`: `rᵢ = vᵢ` (copy from start).
- At `i = k`: `rₖ = vₖ + wₖ` (single-component advance).
- For `k < i ≤ m`: `rᵢ = wᵢ` (copy from displacement).

So `ord(v ⊕ w) = [r₂, ..., rₘ] = [v₂, ..., v_{k-1}, vₖ + wₖ, w_{k+1}, ..., wₘ]`.

For the right-hand side, `w_ord = [w₂, ..., wₘ]` has `actionPoint(w_ord) = k - 1`, since `(w_ord)ⱼ = w_{j+1}` and the first nonzero `w_{j+1}` occurs at `j + 1 = k`, i.e. `j = k - 1`. The application is well-defined: `actionPoint(w_ord) = k − 1 ≤ m − 1 = #ord(v)`, since `k ≤ m` by precondition. By TumblerAdd for `ord(v) ⊕ w_ord`:

- For `1 ≤ j < k-1`: `(ord(v) ⊕ w_ord)ⱼ = ord(v)ⱼ = v_{j+1}`.
- At `j = k-1`: `(ord(v) ⊕ w_ord)_{k-1} = ord(v)_{k-1} + (w_ord)_{k-1} = vₖ + wₖ`.
- For `k-1 < j ≤ m-1`: `(ord(v) ⊕ w_ord)ⱼ = (w_ord)ⱼ = w_{j+1}`.

So `ord(v) ⊕ w_ord = [v₂, ..., v_{k-1}, vₖ + wₖ, w_{k+1}, ..., wₘ]`.

The two sequences are identical component by component. ∎

*Instance (a).* Let `v = [1, 3, 5]`, `w = [0, 0, 2]` (action point 3). Then `v ⊕ w = [1, 3, 7]` and `ord([1, 3, 7]) = [3, 7]`. On the right, `ord(v) = [3, 5]` and `w_ord = [0, 2]`, giving `[3, 5] ⊕ [0, 2] = [3, 7]`. Both sides agree.

*Instance (b).* Let `v = [1, 3, 5]`, `w = [0, 4, 0]` (action point 2). Then `v ⊕ w = [1, 7, 0]` and `ord([1, 7, 0]) = [7, 0]`. On the right, `ord(v) = [3, 5]` and `w_ord = [4, 0]`, giving `[3, 5] ⊕ [4, 0] = [7, 0]`. Both sides agree. Note that `[7, 0] ∉ S` — the zero in the tail component after the action point places the result outside TA7a's domain S, illustrating the S-membership boundary.

*Formal Contract:*
- *Preconditions:* `v ∈ T`, `#v = m ≥ 2`; `w ∈ T`, `w > 0`, `#w = m`, `w₁ = 0`, `actionPoint(w) ≤ m`.
- *Postconditions:* (a) `ord(v ⊕ w) = ord(v) ⊕ w_ord`. (b) `subspace(v ⊕ w) = subspace(v)` — since `k ≥ 2`, TumblerAdd copies `r₁ = v₁` from the start, preserving the subspace identifier. (c) Full decomposition: `v ⊕ w = vpos(subspace(v), ord(v) ⊕ w_ord)` — let `r = v ⊕ w`; by TA0 `#r = #w = m ≥ 2`, so the generalized inverse (vpos contract (b)) applies to `r`: `vpos(subspace(r), ord(r)) = r`; substituting `subspace(r) = subspace(v)` from (b) and `ord(r) = ord(v) ⊕ w_ord` from (a) yields the result. Note that `ord(v) ⊕ w_ord` need not lie in S — the definition and inverse properties of vpos are pure sequence operations that hold for any `o ∈ T`.
- *Frame:* Both sides are computed from `v` and `w` alone — no state is consulted.
