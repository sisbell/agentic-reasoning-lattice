We wish to understand what algebraic structure the Xanadu addressing system must possess. The system assigns every entity a permanent address — a *tumbler* — and requires these addresses to support comparison, containment testing, arithmetic for span computation and position advancement, and coordination-free allocation across a global network. We seek the minimal set of abstract properties that any correct implementation must provide, deriving each from design requirements rather than from any particular representation.

The approach is: state what the system must guarantee, then discover what properties of the address algebra are necessary and sufficient for those guarantees. We begin with the carrier set and work outward.

Nelson conceived this system as "the tumbler line" — a flat linearization of a hierarchical tree, yielding a total order on all addresses. Gregory implemented it as fixed-width sign-magnitude arithmetic over 16-digit mantissas. Between these two accounts we find the abstract algebra: what must hold for any correct implementation, regardless of representation.
