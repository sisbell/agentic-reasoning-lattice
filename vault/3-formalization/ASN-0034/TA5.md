## Increment for allocation

A separate operation, distinct from the shifting arithmetic, handles address allocation. When the system allocates a new address, it takes the highest existing address in a partition and produces the next one. This is not addition of a width; it is advancement of a counter at a specified hierarchical level.

The *last significant position* `sig(t)` of a tumbler — defined in TA5-SIG — identifies the rightmost nonzero component, or `#t` when all components are zero. For valid addresses, `sig(t) = #t` (TA5-SigValid), so `inc(t, 0)` on a valid address increments the last component of the last field, modifying only within that field and preserving the hierarchical structure.

**TA5 (HierarchicalIncrement).** For tumbler `t ∈ T` and level `k ≥ 0`, there exists an operation `inc(t, k)` producing tumbler `t'` such that:

  (a) `t' > t` (strictly greater under T1),

  (b) when `k = 0`: `t'` agrees with `t` at every position other than `sig(t)`; when `k > 0`: `t'` agrees with `t` on all original positions,

  (c) when `k = 0` (*sibling*): `#t' = #t` and `t'_{sig(t)} = t_{sig(t)} + 1`,

  (d) when `k > 0` (*child*): `#t' = #t + k`, the `k - 1` intermediate positions `#t + 1, ..., #t + k - 1` are set to `0` (field separators), and the final position `#t + k` is set to `1` (the first child).

*Proof.* We must show that for every `t ∈ T` and `k ≥ 0`, the construction below produces a tumbler `t' = inc(t, k)` satisfying all four postconditions. Recall that `sig(t)` denotes the last significant position of `t`: when `t` has at least one nonzero component, `sig(t) = max({i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t ∧ tᵢ ≠ 0})`; when every component of `t` is zero, `sig(t) = #t`.

**Construction.** Let `t = t₁. ... .tₘ` where `m = #t`, and let `k ≥ 0`. Define `t' = inc(t, k)` by cases.

When `k = 0` (*sibling increment*): set `t'ᵢ = tᵢ` for all `i ≠ sig(t)`, and `t'_{sig(t)} = t_{sig(t)} + 1`. The result has the same length: `#t' = m`.

When `k > 0` (*child creation*): set `t'ᵢ = tᵢ` for `1 ≤ i ≤ m`, set `t'ᵢ = 0` for `m + 1 ≤ i ≤ m + k - 1` (the `k - 1` field separators), and set `t'_{m+k} = 1` (the first child). The result has length `#t' = m + k`.

In both cases `t'` is a finite sequence of natural numbers with length ≥ 1, so `t' ∈ T`.

**Verification of (b)** (agreement at non-modified positions). For `k = 0`: by construction `t'ᵢ = tᵢ` for all `i ≠ sig(t)`, so in particular for every `i` with `1 ≤ i ≤ #t` and `i ≠ sig(t)` — this covers both the positions preceding `sig(t)` and any trailing positions beyond it. For `k > 0`: by construction `t'ᵢ = tᵢ` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ m`, so `t'` agrees with `t` on every original position.

**Verification of (c)** (sibling structure). When `k = 0`: `#t' = m = #t` by construction. At position `sig(t)`, `t'_{sig(t)} = t_{sig(t)} + 1` by construction; agreement at all other positions is established in (b).

**Verification of (d)** (child structure). When `k > 0`: `#t' = m + k = #t + k` by construction. Positions `m + 1` through `m + k - 1` are `0` (field separators) — when `k = 1` this range is empty, so no separators are introduced. Position `m + k` is `1` (the first child).

**Verification of (a)** (`t' > t`). We establish `t < t'` under the lexicographic order T1, treating each case separately.

*Case `k = 0`.* Let `j = sig(t)`. By construction, `t'ᵢ = tᵢ` for all `i ≠ j`, so in particular the tumblers agree at every position `1 ≤ i < j` — this is part (b). At position `j`: `t'_j = t_j + 1 > t_j`, since `n + 1 > n` for every `n ∈ ℕ`. Since `j = sig(t) ≤ m` and `#t' = m`, we have `j ≤ min(#t, #t') = m`, so both tumblers have a component at position `j`. By T1 case (i) with divergence position `j`, the agreement on positions `1, ..., j - 1` and the strict inequality `t_j < t'_j` yield `t < t'`.

*Case `k > 0`.* By part (b), `t'ᵢ = tᵢ` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ m` — the tumblers agree on every position of `t`. T1 case (ii) requires a witness position `j` satisfying `j = #t + 1 ≤ #t'`; taking `j = m + 1 = #t + 1`, the remaining task is the length inequality `#t + 1 ≤ #t' = m + k`. Two T0 facts discharge it. First, T0's discreteness (instantiated at `m = 0`: no natural lies strictly between `0` and `0 + 1`) sharpens the hypothesis `k > 0` in ℕ to `k ≥ 1`, since any `k ∈ ℕ` with `0 < k < 1` is ruled out. Second, T0's order-compatibility of addition (`p ≤ n ⟹ m + p ≤ m + n`), instantiated at `m = #t`, `p = 1`, `n = k`, lifts `1 ≤ k` to `#t + 1 ≤ #t + k`. Combined with the construction's `#t' = m + k`, this yields `m + 1 ≤ #t'`, so T1 case (ii) applies: `t` is a proper prefix of `t'`, giving `t < t'`. ∎

*Formal Contract:*
- *Preconditions:* `t ∈ T`, `k ≥ 0`.
- *Definition:* `inc(t, k)`: when `k = 0`, modify position `sig(t)` (TA5-SIG) to `t_{sig(t)} + 1`; when `k > 0`, extend by `k` positions with `k - 1` zeros and final `1`.
- *Depends:* T0 (CarrierSetDefinition) — the conclusion `t' ∈ T` at the end of the construction ("`t'` is a finite sequence of natural numbers with length ≥ 1, so `t' ∈ T`") rests on T0's characterisation of T as finite sequences over ℕ with length ≥ 1; the sibling step `t'_{sig(t)} = t_{sig(t)} + 1` (construction for `k = 0` and postcondition (c)) invokes T0's closure of ℕ under successor to confirm that `t_{sig(t)} + 1 ∈ ℕ`, so that `t'` remains a sequence over ℕ; the child construction's designated components — the `k − 1` field separators `0` at positions `#t + 1, ..., #t + k − 1` and the first child `1` at position `#t + k` (construction for `k > 0` and postcondition (d)) — name members of ℕ that T0 enumerates, with `0` supplied as the additive identity and `1` supplied by closure of ℕ under successor, so that the ℕ-membership of the components set in the child branch is discharged from T0 rather than left implicit; the verification of (a) in Case `k = 0` invokes T0's strict successor inequality (`n < n + 1` for every `n ∈ ℕ`) at the step "`t'_j = t_j + 1 > t_j`, since `n + 1 > n` for every `n ∈ ℕ`", supplying the strict inequality at the divergence position `j = sig(t)` that T1 case (i) then consumes, so the "`t_j + 1 > t_j`" claim is discharged from T0 rather than left as an implicit appeal to ℕ-successor behaviour; the verification of (a) in Case `k > 0` invokes two further T0 facts at the length step `#t + 1 ≤ #t + k` that supplies T1 case (ii) with its non-strict witness-position bound, namely T0's discreteness (`m ≤ n < m + 1 ⟹ n = m`, instantiated at `m = 0`) to sharpen the hypothesis `k > 0` in ℕ to `k ≥ 1` — no natural lies strictly between `0` and `0 + 1` — and T0's order-compatibility of addition (`p ≤ n ⟹ m + p ≤ m + n`, instantiated at `m = #t`, `p = 1`, `n = k`) to lift `1 ≤ k` to `#t + 1 ≤ #t + k`, so the "`m + 1 ≤ m + k`" step is discharged from T0 rather than left as an implicit appeal to ℕ-arithmetic, matching the per-step citation convention established for `T1`, `TumblerAdd`, `ActionPoint`, and `PositiveTumbler` and already applied in T10a-N's Depends for the structurally identical step at `m = #t₁`, `p = 1`, `n = k`. T1 (LexicographicOrder) — postcondition (a) invokes T1 case (i) at divergence position `sig(t)` for `k = 0`, and T1 case (ii) with the proper-prefix condition `#t + 1 ≤ #t'` for `k > 0`. TA5-SIG (LastSignificantPosition) — the symbol `sig(t)` in the definition, postcondition (b)'s exclusion quantifier, and postcondition (c)'s increment target all resolve against this definition.
- *Postconditions:* `t' ∈ T`. (a) `t' > t` under T1. (b) When `k = 0`: `(A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t ∧ i ≠ sig(t) : t'ᵢ = tᵢ)`. When `k > 0`: `(A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t : t'ᵢ = tᵢ)`. (c) When `k = 0`: `#t' = #t`, `t'_{sig(t)} = t_{sig(t)} + 1`. (d) When `k > 0`: `#t' = #t + k`, positions `#t + 1 ... #t + k - 1` are `0`, position `#t + k` is `1`.

Gregory's analysis reveals a critical distinction: `inc(t, 0)` does NOT produce the immediate successor of `t` in the total order. In the general case, it produces the smallest same-length tumbler that agrees with `t` on positions `1, ..., sig(t) − 1` and has a strictly larger component at position `sig(t)`. When `sig(t) = #t` — which holds for valid addresses by TA5-SigValid — this is the smallest same-length tumbler strictly greater than `t`: the *next peer* at the same hierarchical depth. When `sig(t) < #t` (i.e., trailing zeros exist beyond the rightmost nonzero component), the gap between `t` and `inc(t, 0)` contains same-length tumblers as well — for example, `(2, 0, 0)` and `inc((2, 0, 0), 0) = (3, 0, 0)` have `(2, 0, 1)` strictly between them. The gap between `t` and `inc(t, 0)` contains the entire subtree of `t`: all tumblers of the form `t.x₁. ... .xₘ` for any `m ≥ 1` and any `x₁ ≥ 0`. The true immediate successor in the total order is `t.0` — the zero-extension — by the prefix convention (T1 case (ii)). For any `k > 0`, `inc(t, k)` does NOT produce the immediate successor of `t` in the total order. For `k = 1` the result is `t.1`; for `k = 2` the result is `t.0.1`. In both cases, `t.0` (the true immediate successor) lies strictly between `t` and the result. The gap between `t` and `inc(t, k)` contains `t`'s entire subtree of zero-extensions. For address allocation, the distinction is harmless: allocation cares about advancing the counter past all existing addresses, not about visiting every point in the total order.

The conditions under which `inc` preserves the structural validity constraint T4 — including the boundary on `k` and the role of `zeros(t)` — are established in TA5a (IncrementPreservesT4).
