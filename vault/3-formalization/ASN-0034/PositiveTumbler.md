## Zero tumblers and positivity

Under T3, the tumblers `[0]`, `[0, 0]`, `[0, 0, 0]`, etc., are *distinct* elements of T — they have different lengths. Under T1, they form a chain: `[0] < [0, 0] < [0, 0, 0] < ...` by the prefix rule. There is no single "zero tumbler"; there are infinitely many all-zero tumblers.

**Definition (PositiveTumbler).** A tumbler `t ∈ T` is *positive*, written `t > 0`, iff at least one of its components is nonzero: `(E i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t : tᵢ ≠ 0)`. A tumbler is a *zero tumbler* iff every component is zero: `(A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t : tᵢ = 0)`.

Every positive tumbler is greater than every zero tumbler under T1 — if `t` has a nonzero component at position `k`, then at position `k` either the zero tumbler has a smaller component (0 < tₖ) or has run out of components, either way placing it below `t`. The condition `w > 0` in TA0 and TA4 excludes all all-zero displacements regardless of length.

*Formal Contract:*
- *Definition:* `t > 0` (positive) iff `(E i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t : tᵢ ≠ 0)`. Zero tumbler: `(A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t : tᵢ = 0)`.
