## T0(a) — UnboundedComponentValues

`(A t ∈ T, i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t : (A M ∈ ℕ :: (E t' ∈ T :: t' agrees with t except t'.dᵢ > M)))`.

## T0(b) — UnboundedDepth

`(A n ∈ ℕ : n ≥ 1 : (E t ∈ T :: #t ≥ n))`.

T0(b) follows from T's definition as the set of all finite sequences over ℕ — for any `n`, the constant sequence `[1, 1, ..., 1]` of length `n` is a member.

## T1 — LexicographicTotalOrder

For tumblers `a = a₁. ... .aₘ` and `b = b₁. ... .bₙ`, define `a < b` iff there exists `k ≥ 1` such that `(A i : 1 ≤ i < k : aᵢ = bᵢ)` and either:

  (i) `k ≤ min(m, n)` and `aₖ < bₖ`, or

  (ii) `k = m + 1 ≤ n` (that is, `a` is a proper prefix of `b`).

T1 gives a total order: for any `a, b ∈ T`, exactly one of `a < b`, `a = b`, `a > b` holds. ℕ is well-ordered, so the lexicographic extension to finite sequences is total.

## T2 — ComputableComparison

The order relation T1 is computable from the two tumblers alone, without consulting any external data structure. The comparison examines at most `min(#a, #b)` component pairs.

## T3 — Each tumbler has exactly one canonical representation; component-wise identit...

`(A a, b ∈ T : a₁ = b₁ ∧ ... ∧ aₙ = bₙ ∧ #a = #b ≡ a = b)`

### Hierarchical structure

Define a *field separator* as a component with value zero. An address tumbler has the form:

`t = N₁. ... .Nₐ . 0 . U₁. ... .Uᵦ . 0 . D₁. ... .Dᵧ . 0 . E₁. ... .Eδ`

where each `Nᵢ, Uⱼ, Dₖ, Eₗ > 0`. The four fields are:

- **Node field** `N₁. ... .Nₐ`: identifies the server.
- **User field** `U₁. ... .Uᵦ`: identifies the account.
- **Document field** `D₁. ... .Dᵧ`: identifies the document and version.
- **Element field** `E₁. ... .Eδ`: identifies the content element. The first component distinguishes the *subspace*: 1 for text content, 2 for links.

Not every tumbler need have all four fields. A tumbler with zero zeros addresses a node. One zero: a user account. Two zeros: a document. Three zeros: an element. The count of zero-valued components determines the specificity level.


## T4 — An address tumbler has at most three zero-valued components as field separato...

Every tumbler `t ∈ T` used as an address contains at most three zero-valued components, appearing in order as field separators, every non-separator component is strictly positive, and every field present in the address has at least one component. Formally, if `t = N₁. ... .Nₐ . 0 . U₁. ... .Uᵦ . 0 . D₁. ... .Dᵧ . 0 . E₁. ... .Eδ`, then `(A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ α : Nᵢ > 0)`, `(A j : 1 ≤ j ≤ β : Uⱼ > 0)`, `(A k : 1 ≤ k ≤ γ : Dₖ > 0)`, `(A l : 1 ≤ l ≤ δ : Eₗ > 0)`, and `α ≥ 1`, `β ≥ 1` when present, `γ ≥ 1` when present, `δ ≥ 1` when present. We call this the *positive-component constraint*: every component of every field is strictly positive. The non-empty field constraint — each present field has at least one component — is equivalent to three syntactic conditions on the raw tumbler: no two zeros are adjacent, the tumbler does not begin with zero, and the tumbler does not end with zero. These conditions ensure that every zero genuinely separates two non-empty fields. Without the non-empty field constraint, a tumbler like `[1, 0, 0, 3]` would have `zeros = 2`, classifying it as a document address with an empty user field — the positive-component constraint holds vacuously on the empty field, but the parse is degenerate. The function `fields(t)` that extracts the node, user, document, and element fields is well-defined and computable from `t` alone. Define `zeros(t) = #{i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t ∧ tᵢ = 0}`. The count of zero-valued components uniquely determines the hierarchical level:

  - `zeros(t) = 0`: `t` is a node address (node field only),
  - `zeros(t) = 1`: `t` is a user address (node and user fields),
  - `zeros(t) = 2`: `t` is a document address (node, user, and document fields),
  - `zeros(t) = 3`: `t` is an element address (all four fields).

This correspondence is injective on levels: each level produces addresses with exactly one zero count, and each zero count corresponds to exactly one level. The correspondence depends on the positive-component constraint — zero components serve exclusively as field separators *because* no field component is zero. Without the positivity constraint, a tumbler like `[1, 0, 0, 3]` would have two zero-valued components but ambiguous parse: the second zero could be a separator or a zero-valued component within the user field. Since field components are strictly positive, zeros appear only as separators, the number of separators determines the number of fields, and the parse is unique.


## T5 — The set of tumblers sharing a prefix forms a contiguous interval under T1

For any tumbler prefix `p`, the set `{t ∈ T : p ≼ t}` (where `≼` denotes "is a prefix of") forms a contiguous interval under T1:

  `[p ≼ a ∧ p ≼ c ∧ a ≤ b ≤ c ⟹ p ≼ b]`

*Proof.* From T1, if `p ≼ a` then `a` agrees with `p` on the first `#p` components. If `a ≤ b ≤ c` and both `a` and `c` share prefix `p`, then `b` must also share prefix `p`. We consider two cases.

*Case 1: `#b ≥ #p`.* If `b` diverged from `p` at some position `k ≤ #p`, then either `bₖ < pₖ` (contradicting `a ≤ b` since `aₖ = pₖ`) or `bₖ > pₖ` (contradicting `b ≤ c` since `cₖ = pₖ`). So `b` agrees with `p` on all `#p` positions, hence `p ≼ b`.

*Case 2: `#b < #p`.* Since `p ≼ a`, we have `#a ≥ #p > #b`, so `b` is shorter than `a`. By T1, `a ≤ b` requires a first divergence point `j ≤ #b` where `aⱼ < bⱼ` (since `a` cannot be a prefix of the shorter `b`). But `aⱼ = pⱼ` (because `j ≤ #b < #p` and `a` shares prefix `p`), so `bⱼ > pⱼ = cⱼ`. This contradicts `b ≤ c`, since `b` exceeds `c` at position `j` and they agree on all prior positions. ∎


## T6 — Containment (same node, same account, same document family, structural subord...

For any two tumblers `a, b ∈ T`, the following are decidable from the addresses alone:

  (a) Whether `a` and `b` share the same node field.

  (b) Whether `a` and `b` share the same node and user fields.

  (c) Whether `a` and `b` share the same node, user, and document-lineage fields.

  (d) Whether the document field of `a` is a prefix of the document field of `b` (structural subordination within a document family).

T6 is a corollary: it follows immediately from T4 — we extract the relevant fields and compare.

T6(d) does not capture derivation history. The document field records the *allocation hierarchy* — who baptised which sub-number — not the *derivation history*. Version `5.3` was allocated under document `5`, but this tells us nothing about which version's content was copied to create `5.3`. Formal version-derivation requires the version graph, not just the address.


## T7 — Subspaces (text, links) within a document's element field are permanently dis...

The subspace identifier (the first component of the element field) permanently separates the address space into disjoint regions. No tumbler in subspace `s₁` can equal or be confused with a tumbler in subspace `s₂ ≠ s₁`.

  `(A a, b ∈ T : a.E₁ ≠ b.E₁ ⟹ a ≠ b)`

T7 is a corollary of T3 (canonical representation) and T4 (hierarchical parsing): if two tumblers differ in their first element-field component, they are distinct. Arithmetic within subspace 1 cannot produce addresses in subspace 2, because the subspace identifier is part of the address, not metadata.

The ordering T1 places all text addresses (subspace 1) before all link addresses (subspace 2) within the same document, because `1 < 2` at the subspace position. This is a consequence of T1, not an assumption.

## T8 — PermanentAddressAllocation

If tumbler `a ∈ T` has been allocated at any point in the system's history, then for all subsequent states, `a` remains in the set of allocated addresses. No operation removes an allocated address from the address space. The set of allocated addresses is monotonically non-decreasing.


## T9 — MonotonicAllocationStream

Within a single allocator's sequential stream, new addresses are strictly monotonically increasing:

  `(A a, b : same_allocator(a, b) ∧ allocated_before(a, b) : a < b)`

This follows from T10a: each allocator advances by `inc(·, 0)`, and since `inc` produces a strictly greater tumbler at each step (TA5(a)), no gaps arise within a single allocator's sibling stream — each address is exactly one increment beyond the previous.

T9 is scoped to a *single allocator's sequential stream*, not to arbitrary partitions. A server-level subtree spans multiple independent allocators (one per user). Those allocators operate concurrently — T10 guarantees they need no coordination. T9 applies within each user's allocation stream independently.

The global tumbler line does NOT grow monotonically by creation time. A child address `p.1` is inserted between the parent `p` and the parent's next sibling `q`: `p < p.1 < q`, regardless of creation order.

A consequence of T8 and T9 together: the set of allocated addresses is a *growing set* in the lattice-theoretic sense — it can only increase, and new elements always appear at the frontier of each allocator's domain.


## T10 — CoordinationFreeUniqueness

Let `p₁` and `p₂` be prefixes such that neither is a prefix of the other (`p₁ ⋠ p₂ ∧ p₂ ⋠ p₁`). Then for any tumbler `a` with prefix `p₁` and any tumbler `b` with prefix `p₂`, `a ≠ b`.

*Proof.* If `a` has prefix `p₁` and `b` has prefix `p₂`, and the prefixes diverge at position `k` with `p₁ₖ ≠ p₂ₖ`, then `aₖ = p₁ₖ ≠ p₂ₖ = bₖ`, so `a ≠ b`. ∎


## T10a — SiblingIncrementRule

Each allocator produces its sibling outputs exclusively by repeated application of `inc(·, 0)` — shallow increment at the last significant position. To spawn a child allocator, the parent performs one `inc(·, k')` with `k' > 0` to establish the child's prefix, then delegates further allocation to the child. The parent's own sibling stream resumes with `inc(·, 0)`.

Since `inc(·, 0)` preserves length (TA5(c)), all sibling outputs from a single allocator have the same length. The `k > 0` operation is reserved exclusively for child-spawning: a single deep increment establishing a new prefix at a deeper level, from which a new allocator continues with its own `inc(·, 0)` stream.


## PrefixOrderingExtension — DisjointPrefixOrderExtension

Let `p₁, p₂ ∈ T` be tumblers such that `p₁ < p₂` and neither is a prefix of the other (`p₁ ⋠ p₂ ∧ p₂ ⋠ p₁`). Then for every `a` extending `p₁` (`p₁ ≼ a`) and every `b` extending `p₂` (`p₂ ≼ b`), `a < b`.

*Proof.* Since `p₁ < p₂` and neither is a prefix of the other, T1 case (i) applies: there exists a position `k ≤ min(#p₁, #p₂)` such that `p₁` and `p₂` agree on positions `1, ..., k-1` and `p₁ₖ < p₂ₖ`. (Case (ii) is excluded because `p₁` is not a proper prefix of `p₂`.) Now `a` extends `p₁`, so `aᵢ = p₁ᵢ` for all `i ≤ #p₁`; in particular `aₖ = p₁ₖ`. Similarly `bₖ = p₂ₖ`. On positions `1, ..., k-1`, `aᵢ = p₁ᵢ = p₂ᵢ = bᵢ`. At position `k`, `aₖ = p₁ₖ < p₂ₖ = bₖ`. So `a < b` by T1 case (i). ∎

## PartitionMonotonicity — CrossAllocatorPrefixOrdering

Within any prefix-delimited partition, the set of allocated addresses is totally ordered by T1, consistently with the allocation order of any single allocator within that partition. For any two sibling sub-partitions with non-nesting prefixes `p₁ < p₂`, every address extending `p₁` precedes every address extending `p₂` under T1.

*Proof.* Consider a partition with prefix `p`. Every allocated address in this partition has prefix `p`, hence lies in the contiguous interval guaranteed by T5. Within the partition, addresses belong to sub-partitions owned by distinct allocators. These sub-partitions have prefixes that are siblings — they share the parent prefix `p` but diverge at the component that distinguishes one allocator from another.

Sibling prefixes are non-nesting. The first sub-partition prefix `t₀` is produced by `inc(parent, k)` with `k > 0`, giving `#t₀ = #parent + k` (by TA5(d)). By T10a, subsequent sibling prefixes are produced by `inc(·, 0)`: `t₁ = inc(t₀, 0)`, `t₂ = inc(t₁, 0)`, and so on. By TA5(c), `inc(t, 0)` preserves the length of `t`: `#inc(t, 0) = #t`. So all sibling prefixes have the same length `#t₀`. Two tumblers of the same length cannot stand in a prefix relationship unless they are equal (a proper prefix is strictly shorter). Since they differ at position `sig(t)` (TA5(c) increments that component), they are unequal, hence non-nesting.

Each allocator's output is monotonic (T9). The sub-partitions are ordered by their prefixes under T1. The prefix ordering extension lemma gives `a < b` for every address `a` under an earlier prefix and every address `b` under a later prefix. Within each sub-partition, allocation order matches address order by T9. ∎


## GlobalUniqueness — SystemWideAllocationUniqueness

No two distinct allocations, anywhere in the system, at any time, produce the same address.

*Proof.* Consider allocations producing addresses `a` and `b` by distinct allocation events. Four cases arise.

*Case 1: Same allocator.* Both addresses are produced by the same allocator's sequential stream. T9 guarantees `a ≠ b` because allocation is strictly monotonic.

*Case 2: Different allocators at the same hierarchical level.* The allocators have prefixes `p₁` and `p₂` that are siblings — neither is a prefix of the other. T10 gives `a ≠ b` directly.

*Case 3: Different allocators with nesting prefixes and different zero counts.* One allocator's prefix nests within another's. These allocators produce addresses with different zero counts: the node allocator produces addresses with `zeros = 1` (user-level), while the element allocator produces addresses with `zeros = 3`. By T4, different zero counts imply different field structure. If `#a ≠ #b`, then `a ≠ b` by T3 directly. If `#a = #b`, then `zeros(a) ≠ zeros(b)` means there exists a position where one is zero and the other nonzero — by T3, `a ≠ b`.

*Case 4: Different allocators with nesting prefixes and the same zero count.* By T10a, the parent allocator uses `inc(·, 0)` for all its sibling allocations. Its first output has some length `γ₁`; since `inc(·, 0)` preserves length (TA5(c)), all subsequent parent siblings have length `γ₁`. The child allocator's prefix was established by `inc(parent_output, k')` with `k' > 0`, giving prefix length `γ₁ + k'` (by TA5(d)). The child then uses `inc(·, 0)` for its own siblings — all its outputs have the uniform length `γ₁ + k'`. Since `k' ≥ 1`, the child's outputs are strictly longer than the parent's: `γ₁ + k' > γ₁`. By T3, `a ≠ b`. One pair requires separate treatment: the parent's child-spawning output that established the child's prefix has the same length as the child's sibling outputs (both `γ₁ + k'`). However, this output IS the child's base address, and every child sibling output is strictly greater than its base (by TA5(a)), hence distinct. The length separation is additive across nesting levels — each `inc(·, k')` with `k' ≥ 1` adds at least one component, so a descendant `d` nesting levels below has output length at least `γ₁ + d > γ₁`. Allocators at different branches that are not ancestors of each other have non-nesting prefixes and are handled by Case 2.

The argument depends critically on T10a's constraint that sibling allocations use `k = 0`. If a parent allocator could use `k > 0` for siblings, its outputs would have increasing lengths, and some parent output could match the length of a child output, collapsing the length separation. ∎


### Addition for position advancement

Let `⊕` denote tumbler addition: given a start position `a` and a displacement `w`, compute the advanced position.

For a positive displacement `w = [w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ]`, the *action point* is `k = min({i : 1 ≤ i ≤ n ∧ wᵢ ≠ 0})` — the index of the first nonzero component.


## T12 — SpanWellFormedness

A span `(s, ℓ)` is well-formed when `ℓ > 0` and the action point `k` of `ℓ` satisfies `k ≤ #s` (the TA0 precondition for `s ⊕ ℓ`). Equivalently, the number of leading zeros in `ℓ` is strictly less than `#s`. A well-formed span denotes `{t ∈ T : s ≤ t < s ⊕ ℓ}`. This set is contiguous under T1.

Contiguity is definitional: the span is an interval `[s, s ⊕ ℓ)` in a totally ordered set, and intervals in total orders are contiguous. Non-emptiness follows from TA-strict: since `ℓ > 0` and `k ≤ #s`, TA0 gives `s ⊕ ℓ ∈ T`, and TA-strict gives `s ⊕ ℓ > s` directly. The interval `[s, s ⊕ ℓ)` is therefore non-empty — it contains at least `s` itself.

We reserve T5 for the distinct claim that *prefix-defined* sets are contiguous — a non-trivial property of the lexicographic order.


## TA0 — AdditionWellDefinedness

For tumblers `a, w ∈ T` where `w > 0` and the action point `k` of `w` satisfies `k ≤ #a`, the result `a ⊕ w` is a well-defined tumbler in `T`.

The precondition `k ≤ #a` is essential: the constructive definition copies components `a₁, ..., aₖ₋₁` from the start position and adds `wₖ` to `aₖ`, so position `k` must exist within `a`.


## TA1 — WeakOrderPreservation

`(A a, b, w : a < b ∧ w > 0 ∧ k ≤ min(#a, #b) : a ⊕ w ≤ b ⊕ w)`, where `k` is the action point of `w`.

The precondition `k ≤ min(#a, #b)` inherits from TA0: both operations must be well-defined.

Strict order preservation holds under a tighter condition.

## Divergence — Divergence point of two unequal tumblers (DEFINITION, function)

For tumblers `a, b ∈ T` with `a ≠ b`, the *divergence* `divergence(a, b)` is defined by two cases corresponding to the two cases of T1:

  (i) If there exists `k ≤ min(#a, #b)` such that `aₖ ≠ bₖ` and `(A i : 1 ≤ i < k : aᵢ = bᵢ)`, then `divergence(a, b) = k` — component divergence at a shared position.

  (ii) If `(A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ min(#a, #b) : aᵢ = bᵢ)` and `#a ≠ #b`, then `divergence(a, b) = min(#a, #b) + 1` — prefix divergence, where one tumbler is a proper prefix of the other.

Exactly one case applies for any `a ≠ b`.

For prefix-related pairs, `divergence(a, b) = min(#a, #b) + 1 > min(#a, #b)`. Since TA0 requires `k ≤ min(#a, #b)`, the condition `k ≥ divergence(a, b)` in TA1-strict is unsatisfiable for prefix-related operands. TA1-strict makes no claim about prefix-related pairs — TA1 (weak) covers them, guaranteeing non-reversal.


## TA1-strict — Addition preserves the total order (strict) when k ≤ min(#a, #b) ∧ k ≥ divergence(a, b)

`(A a, b, w : a < b ∧ w > 0 ∧ k ≤ min(#a, #b) ∧ k ≥ divergence(a, b) : a ⊕ w < b ⊕ w)`, where `k` is the action point of `w`.

When the action point falls before the divergence — `k < divergence(a, b)` — both operands agree at position `k`, both get the same `wₖ` added, and both copy the same tail from `w` afterward. The original divergence is erased and the results are equal. Order degrades to equality, never reversal.


## TA-strict — Adding a positive displacement strictly advances

`(A a ∈ T, w > 0 : a ⊕ w > a)` (where `a ⊕ w` is well-defined, i.e., `k ≤ #a` per TA0).

**Verification.** Let `k` be the action point of `w`. By the constructive definition, `(a ⊕ w)ᵢ = aᵢ` for `i < k`, and `(a ⊕ w)ₖ = aₖ + wₖ`. Since `k` is the action point, `wₖ > 0`, so `aₖ + wₖ > aₖ`. Positions `1` through `k - 1` agree; position `k` is strictly larger. By T1 case (i), `a ⊕ w > a`.


## TA2 — Tumbler subtraction a ⊖ w is well-defined when a ≥ w

For tumblers `a, w ∈ T` where `a ≥ w`, `a ⊖ w` is a well-defined tumbler in `T`.

**Verification of TA2.** By TumblerSub, two cases arise. If the zero-padded sequences of `a` and `w` agree at every position, the result is the zero tumbler of length `max(#a, #w)` — a member of `T`. Otherwise, let `k` be the first divergence position (after zero-padding). The result `a ⊖ w = [r₁, ..., r_p]` has length `p = max(#a, #w)`, which is finite and at least 1. Each pre-divergence component `rᵢ = 0 ∈ ℕ`. At the divergence point: `a ≥ w` ensures `aₖ > wₖ` — if `a > w` by T1 case (i), the divergence falls at `k ≤ min(#a, #w)` with `aₖ > wₖ` directly; if `a > w` by T1 case (ii), `w` is a proper prefix of `a`, so `k > #w` and `wₖ = 0` (zero-padded), with `aₖ > 0` (otherwise no divergence at `k`). In either case, `rₖ = aₖ - wₖ ∈ ℕ`. Each tail component `rᵢ = aᵢ ∈ ℕ` (inherited from `a ∈ T`, or `0` when `i > #a`). The result is a finite sequence of non-negative integers with at least one component — a member of `T`.


## TA3 — Subtraction preserves the total order (weak)

`(A a, b, w : a < b ∧ a ≥ w ∧ b ≥ w : a ⊖ w ≤ b ⊖ w)`.

## TA3-strict — Subtraction preserves the total order (strict) when additionally #a = #b

`(A a, b, w : a < b ∧ a ≥ w ∧ b ≥ w ∧ #a = #b : a ⊖ w < b ⊖ w)`.

### Partial inverse


## TA4 — Addition and subtraction are partial inverses

`(A a, w : w > 0 ∧ k = #a ∧ #w = k ∧ (A i : 1 ≤ i < k : aᵢ = 0) : (a ⊕ w) ⊖ w = a)`, where `k` is the action point of `w`.


## ReverseInverse — ReversePartialInverse

`(A a, w : a ≥ w ∧ w > 0 ∧ k = #a ∧ #w = k ∧ (A i : 1 ≤ i < k : aᵢ = 0) : (a ⊖ w) ⊕ w = a)`, where `k` is the action point of `w`.

*Proof.* Let `y = a ⊖ w`. We verify the prerequisites for applying TA4 to `y`. Under the precondition `(A i : 1 ≤ i < k : aᵢ = 0)`, we have `aᵢ = wᵢ = 0` for all `i < k`, so the divergence falls at position `k`. The result `y` has: positions `i < k` zero, position `k` equal to `aₖ - wₖ`, and no components beyond `k` (since `k = #a`). So `#y = k`, `yᵢ = 0` for `i < k`, and `#w = k`. All preconditions for TA4 hold. By TA4, `(y ⊕ w) ⊖ w = y`. Suppose `y ⊕ w ≠ a`. We wish to apply TA3-strict, which requires three preconditions beyond strict ordering: `y ⊕ w ≥ w`, `a ≥ w`, and `#(y ⊕ w) = #a`. The equal-length condition holds: `#(y ⊕ w) = #w = k = #a` (the first step by the result-length identity; `#w = k` and `k = #a` are given). The condition `a ≥ w` is given. We verify `y ⊕ w ≥ w`: since `y ⊕ w ≠ a` and `yₖ = aₖ - wₖ`, we have `yₖ > 0` (if `yₖ = 0` then `aₖ = wₖ`, and since `yᵢ = wᵢ = 0` for `i < k` and `#y = k = #w`, we would have `y = [0,...,0]` and `y ⊕ w = w`; but `a ≥ w` and `aₖ = wₖ` with agreement on all prior positions gives `a = w` when `#a = #w = k`, so `y ⊕ w = w = a`, contradicting our assumption). So `yₖ > 0`, giving `(y ⊕ w)ₖ = yₖ + wₖ > wₖ` with agreement on positions before `k`, hence `y ⊕ w > w`. Now apply TA3-strict. If `y ⊕ w > a`, then `(y ⊕ w) ⊖ w > a ⊖ w = y`, giving `y > y`, a contradiction. If `y ⊕ w < a`, then `(y ⊕ w) ⊖ w < a ⊖ w`, giving `y < y`, a contradiction. So `(a ⊖ w) ⊕ w = a`. ∎

### Constructive definition of ⊕ and ⊖


## TumblerAdd — AdditionDefinition

Let `a = [a₁, ..., aₘ]` and `w = [w₁, ..., wₙ]` with `w > 0`. With action point `k`:

```
         ⎧ aᵢ           if i < k        (copy from start)
rᵢ   =  ⎨ aₖ + wₖ      if i = k        (single-component advance)
         ⎩ wᵢ           if i > k        (copy from displacement)
```

The result `a ⊕ w = [r₁, ..., rₚ]` has length `p = max(k - 1, 0) + (n - k + 1)`. Since `w > 0` implies `k ≥ 1`, this simplifies to `p = (k - 1) + (n - k + 1) = n = #w`. *Result-length identity:* **`#(a ⊕ w) = #w`**.

**Precondition:** `k ≤ m` — the displacement's action point must fall within the start position's length.

**No carry propagation:** The sum `aₖ + wₖ` at the action point is a single natural-number addition. There is no carry into position `k - 1`.

**Tail replacement, not tail addition:** Components after the action point come entirely from `w`. The start position's components at positions `k + 1, ..., m` are discarded. `a ⊕ w` does not add corresponding components pairwise.

**The many-to-one property:** `aᵢ = bᵢ` for all `i ≤ k` implies `a ⊕ w = b ⊕ w`.


## TumblerSub — SubtractionDefinition

Given end position `a` and displacement `w`, recover the start position. When the zero-padded sequences agree at every position (no divergence exists), the result is the zero tumbler of length `max(#a, #w)`. Otherwise, let `k` be the first position where `a` and `w` differ (treating missing components as zero):

```
         ⎧ 0             if i < k        (these levels matched — zero them)
rᵢ   =  ⎨ aₖ - wₖ      if i = k        (reverse the advance)
         ⎩ aᵢ           if i > k        (copy from end position)
```

The result has length `max(#a, #w)`.

**Precondition:** `a ≥ w` — when `a ≠ w`, at the divergence point (after zero-padding) `aₖ ≥ wₖ`.


### Verification of TA1 and TA1-strict

**Claim:** (TA1, weak form). If `a < b`, `w > 0`, and `k ≤ min(#a, #b)`, then `a ⊕ w ≤ b ⊕ w`.

**Claim:** (TA1-strict). If additionally `k ≥ divergence(a, b)`, then `a ⊕ w < b ⊕ w`.

*Proof.* Let `j = divergence(a, b)`. In case (i) of the Divergence definition, `aⱼ < bⱼ`; in case (ii), `j = min(#a, #b) + 1` exceeds both tumblers' shared positions and the ordering `a < b` follows from the prefix rule. Three cases arise.

*Case 1: `k < j`.* Both `a` and `b` agree at position `k` (since `k < j`), so `(a ⊕ w)ₖ = aₖ + wₖ = bₖ + wₖ = (b ⊕ w)ₖ`. At positions after `k`, both results copy from `w`, giving identical tails. So `a ⊕ w = b ⊕ w`. The weak form (`≤`) holds. The strict form does not — the original divergence is erased by tail replacement.

*Case 2: `k = j`.* At position `k`, `(a ⊕ w)ₖ = aₖ + wₖ < bₖ + wₖ = (b ⊕ w)ₖ` (since `aₖ < bₖ` and natural-number addition preserves strict inequality). Positions before `k` agree. So `a ⊕ w < b ⊕ w` strictly.

*Case 3: `k > j`.* For `i < k`, the constructive definition gives `(a ⊕ w)ᵢ = aᵢ` and `(b ⊕ w)ᵢ = bᵢ`. Since `j < k`, the divergence at position `j` is preserved: `(a ⊕ w)ⱼ = aⱼ < bⱼ = (b ⊕ w)ⱼ`. So `a ⊕ w < b ⊕ w` strictly. ∎

In all three cases, `a ⊕ w ≤ b ⊕ w`. Strict inequality holds in Cases 2 and 3, i.e., whenever `k ≥ j = divergence(a, b)`.


### Verification of TA3

**Claim:** (TA3, weak form). If `a < b`, `a ≥ w`, and `b ≥ w`, then `a ⊖ w ≤ b ⊖ w`.

*Proof.* We first handle the case where `a < b` by the prefix rule (T1 case (ii)), then the component-divergence cases.

*Case 0: `a` is a proper prefix of `b`.* Then `#a < #b` and `aᵢ = bᵢ` for all `i ≤ #a`.

We first handle the sub-case `a = w`. Then `a ⊖ w = [0, ..., 0]` (the zero tumbler of length `max(#a, #w) = #w = #a`). Since `b > a = w` and `a` is a proper prefix of `b`, we have `bᵢ = wᵢ` for all `i ≤ #w`. Two sub-sub-cases arise. If `b ⊖ w` is a positive tumbler — some component of `b` beyond `#w` is nonzero — then every zero tumbler is less than every positive tumbler (TA6), so `a ⊖ w < b ⊖ w`. If `b ⊖ w` is itself a zero tumbler — all components of `b` beyond `#w` are zero, so zero-padded `w` equals `b` — then `b ⊖ w = [0, ..., 0]` of length `max(#b, #w) = #b`. Both results are zero tumblers, but `#(a ⊖ w) = #a < #b = #(b ⊖ w)` (since `a` is a proper prefix of `b`). The shorter zero tumbler is a proper prefix of the longer, so `a ⊖ w < b ⊖ w` by T1 case (ii). In either sub-sub-case, `a ⊖ w ≤ b ⊖ w`. The sub-case is resolved.

For `a > w`: two sub-cases arise depending on the structure of the divergence between `a` and `w` (after zero-padding).

*Sub-case `a > w` with divergence.* If `a > w` by T1 case (i), the divergence `dₐ` is at a shared position `≤ min(#a, #w) ≤ #a`. If `a > w` by T1 case (ii), `w` is a proper prefix of `a`; after zero-padding `w` to length `#a`, we compare: if at least one component `aᵢ > 0` for `i > #w`, the divergence falls at the smallest such `i`, satisfying `#w < dₐ ≤ #a`. In either T1 case, `dₐ ≤ #a`. Since `bᵢ = aᵢ` for all `i ≤ #a` and `dₐ ≤ #a`, the comparison of `b` (zero-padded) against `w` (zero-padded) agrees with that of `a` at all positions up to `dₐ`. So `d_b = dₐ = d`.

Now apply the subtraction formula to both. At positions `i < d`: both results are zero. At position `d`: both compute `a_d - w_d = b_d - w_d`, since `a_d = b_d` for `d ≤ #a`. At positions `d < i ≤ #a`: both copy from the minuend, giving `aᵢ = bᵢ`. The two results agree on all positions `1, ..., #a`.

Beyond position `#a`, the results may differ. The result `a ⊖ w` has length `max(#a, #w)`. At positions `#a < i ≤ max(#a, #w)` (present only when `#w > #a`): `(a ⊖ w)ᵢ = 0` (from `a`'s zero padding). For `(b ⊖ w)ᵢ`: when `i ≤ #b`, the value is `bᵢ` (copied in the tail phase since `i > d`); when `i > #b`, the value is `0` (from `b`'s zero padding). In either case `(a ⊖ w)ᵢ ≤ (b ⊖ w)ᵢ`. The result `b ⊖ w` has length `max(#b, #w) ≥ max(#a, #w)` (since `#b > #a`). If `max(#b, #w) > max(#a, #w)`, the extra positions come from `b`'s components beyond `max(#a, #w)` when `#b > #w` (copied from the minuend), or are zero when `#w > #b` (from `b`'s zero padding). Now `a ⊖ w` is no longer than `b ⊖ w`, and they agree on positions `1, ..., #a`. We compare lexicographically. If no disagreement exists on positions `1, ..., max(#a, #w)`, then `a ⊖ w` is a prefix of `b ⊖ w` (since `#(a ⊖ w) ≤ #(b ⊖ w)`), giving `a ⊖ w ≤ b ⊖ w` by T1 case (ii). If a first disagreement exists at some position `j > #a`, then `(a ⊖ w)ⱼ = 0 ≤ (b ⊖ w)ⱼ` (where `(b ⊖ w)ⱼ = bⱼ` when `j ≤ #b`, or `0` when `j > #b`). If the disagreement is strict (`(a ⊖ w)ⱼ = 0 < (b ⊖ w)ⱼ`), we have `a ⊖ w < b ⊖ w` by T1 case (i). If `(b ⊖ w)ⱼ = 0` at all positions `#a < j ≤ max(#a, #w)`, then `a ⊖ w` and `b ⊖ w` agree through position `max(#a, #w)`, and `a ⊖ w` is a prefix of the longer `b ⊖ w`, giving `a ⊖ w ≤ b ⊖ w` by T1 case (ii). In either case, `a ⊖ w ≤ b ⊖ w`.

*Sub-case `a > w` without divergence (zero-padded equality).* If `a > w` by T1 case (ii) and `aᵢ = 0` for all `i > #w`, then after zero-padding `w` to length `#a`, the padded sequences are identical — no divergence exists. The subtraction `a ⊖ w` yields the zero tumbler of length `max(#a, #w) = #a`. For `b ⊖ w`: since `b > a > w` and `#b > #a ≥ #w`, `b` agrees with `w` (hence with `a`) on positions `1, ..., #a`. Beyond `#a`, `b` has components that `a` lacks. The result `b ⊖ w` has length `max(#b, #w) = #b > #a`. The zero tumbler `a ⊖ w` of length `#a` is a proper prefix of the zero tumbler of length `#b` (if `b ⊖ w` is all zeros), giving `a ⊖ w < b ⊖ w` by T1 case (ii). If `b ⊖ w` has any positive component, then `a ⊖ w` (all zeros) is less than `b ⊖ w` by TA6. In either case, `a ⊖ w ≤ b ⊖ w`. The sub-case is resolved.

For the remaining cases, `a < b` by T1 case (i): there exists `j ≤ min(#a, #b)` with `aⱼ < bⱼ`. Let `dₐ = divergence(a, w)` and `d_b = divergence(b, w)` (under zero-padding).

*Case 1: `dₐ = d_b = d`.* For `i < d`, both results are zero. At position `d`, we need `j ≥ d` (since `a` and `b` agree with `w` before `d`). If `j = d`: `a_d - w_d < b_d - w_d`, so `a ⊖ w < b ⊖ w`. If `j > d`: `a_d = b_d`, so both results agree at `d`; at positions `d < i < j`, both copy from their respective minuends which agree; at position `j`, `aⱼ < bⱼ`. So `a ⊖ w < b ⊖ w`.

*Case 2: `dₐ < d_b`.* At position `dₐ`: `a_{dₐ} ≠ w_{dₐ}` but `b_{dₐ} = w_{dₐ}`. Since `a < b` and they agree with `w` before `dₐ`, we have `j = dₐ` with `a_{dₐ} < b_{dₐ} = w_{dₐ}`. But `a ≥ w` requires `a_{dₐ} ≥ w_{dₐ}` at the divergence — contradiction. This case is impossible under the preconditions.

*Case 3: `dₐ > d_b`.* At position `d_b`: `b_{d_b} ≠ w_{d_b}` but `a_{d_b} = w_{d_b}`. So `j = d_b` with `a_{d_b} = w_{d_b} < b_{d_b}`. The result `(a ⊖ w)_{d_b} = 0` and `(b ⊖ w)_{d_b} = b_{d_b} - w_{d_b} > 0`. So `a ⊖ w < b ⊖ w`. ∎

**Claim:** (TA3-strict). If `a < b`, `a ≥ w`, `b ≥ w`, and `#a = #b`, then `a ⊖ w < b ⊖ w`.

*Proof.* The equal-length precondition eliminates Case 0 entirely — two tumblers of the same length cannot be in a prefix relationship unless equal, and `a < b` rules out equality. Only Cases 1–3 apply, all of which produce strict inequality. ∎


### Verification of TA4

**Claim.** `(a ⊕ w) ⊖ w = a` under the full precondition: `k = #a`, `#w = k`, `(A i : 1 ≤ i < k : aᵢ = 0)`.

*Proof.* Let `k` be the action point of `w`. Since `k = #a`, the addition `a ⊕ w` produces a result `r` with: `rᵢ = aᵢ = 0` for `i < k` (by the zero-prefix condition), `rₖ = aₖ + wₖ`, and `rᵢ = wᵢ` for `i > k`. Crucially, there are no components of `a` beyond position `k` — the tail replacement discards nothing. By the result-length identity, `#r = #w = k`, so `r = [0, ..., 0, aₖ + wₖ]`.

Now subtract `w` from `r`. The subtraction scans for the first divergence between `r` and `w`. For `i < k`: `rᵢ = 0 = wᵢ` (both are zero — `aᵢ` by the zero-prefix precondition, `wᵢ` by definition of action point). Two sub-cases arise at position `k`.

*Sub-case (i): `aₖ > 0`.* Then `rₖ = aₖ + wₖ > wₖ`, and the first divergence is at position `k`. The subtraction produces: positions `i < k` get zero, position `k` gets `rₖ - wₖ = aₖ`, and positions `i > k` copy from `r`, giving `rᵢ = wᵢ`. Since `k = #a` and `#w = k`, there are no trailing components. The result is `[0, ..., 0, aₖ] = a`. For valid addresses, T4's positive-component constraint guarantees `aₖ > 0`, so this sub-case always applies in the address context.

*Sub-case (ii): `aₖ = 0`.* Then `a` is a zero tumbler. The addition gives `rₖ = wₖ`. Since `#r = #w` (result-length identity) and `#w = k` (precondition), we have `r = w`. The subtraction `w ⊖ w` yields the zero tumbler of length `k`, which is `a`. ∎


### Cancellation properties of ⊕

## TA5 — Hierarchical increment inc(t, k) produces t' > t

For tumbler `t ∈ T` and level `k ≥ 0`, there exists an operation `inc(t, k)` producing tumbler `t'` such that:

  (a) `t' > t` (strictly greater under T1),

  (b) `t'` agrees with `t` on all components before the increment point,

  (c) when `k = 0` (*sibling*): `#t' = #t`, and `t'` differs from `t` only at position `sig(t)`, where `t'_{sig(t)} = t_{sig(t)} + 1`,

  (d) when `k > 0` (*child*): `#t' = #t + k`, the `k - 1` intermediate positions `#t + 1, ..., #t + k - 1` are set to `0` (field separators), and the final position `#t + k` is set to `1` (the first child).

We verify `inc(t, k) > t` for both cases. For `k = 0`: `t'` agrees with `t` on positions `1, ..., sig(t) - 1` and exceeds `t` at position `sig(t)`, so `t' > t` by T1 case (i). For `k > 0`: `t'` agrees with `t` on positions `1, ..., #t`, and `#t' > #t`, so `t` is a proper prefix of `t'`, giving `t < t'` by T1 case (ii).

`inc(t, 0)` does NOT produce the immediate successor of `t` in the total order. It produces the next peer at the same hierarchical depth — the smallest tumbler with the same length that is strictly greater than `t`. The gap between `t` and `inc(t, 0)` contains the entire subtree of `t`: all tumblers of the form `t.x₁. ... .xₘ` for any `m ≥ 1` and any `x₁ ≥ 0`. The true immediate successor in the total order is `t.0` by T1 case (ii). For `k = 1` the result is `t.1`; for `k = 2` the result is `t.0.1`. In both cases, `t.0` lies strictly between `t` and the result.

**TA5 preserves T4 when `k ≤ 2` and `zeros(t) + k - 1 ≤ 3`.** Two constraints must hold simultaneously: the zero-count bound and a structural constraint against adjacent zeros.

For `k = 0`: no zeros are added — `zeros(t') = zeros(t)`, and no new adjacencies are introduced. T4 is preserved unconditionally.

For `k = 1`: one component is appended (the child value `1`), with no new zero separators — `zeros(t') = zeros(t)`. Since the appended component is positive and the last component of `t` is positive (by T4), no adjacent zeros are created. T4 is preserved when `zeros(t) ≤ 3`.

For `k = 2`: one zero separator and one child value `1` are appended, giving `zeros(t') = zeros(t) + 1`. The appended sequence is `[0, 1]` — the zero is flanked by the last component of `t` (positive, by T4's non-empty field constraint) and the new child `1`, so no adjacent zeros are created. T4 is preserved when `zeros(t) ≤ 2`.

For `k ≥ 3`: the appended sequence `[0, 0, ..., 0, 1]` contains `k - 1 ≥ 2` zeros, of which at least two are adjacent. This violates T4's non-empty field constraint. T4 is violated for all `k ≥ 3`.

The effective constraints are: `k = 0` (always valid), `k = 1` (when `zeros(t) ≤ 3`), `k = 2` (when `zeros(t) ≤ 2`).


### Zero tumblers and positivity

Under T3, the tumblers `[0]`, `[0, 0]`, `[0, 0, 0]`, etc., are *distinct* elements of T — they have different lengths. Under T1, they form a chain: `[0] < [0, 0] < [0, 0, 0] < ...` by the prefix rule. There is no single "zero tumbler"; there are infinitely many all-zero tumblers.


## TA6 — Every all-zero tumbler (any length) is less than every positive tumbler and is not a valid address

No zero tumbler is a valid address — no all-zero tumbler designates content. Every zero tumbler is less than every positive tumbler under T1.

  `(A t ∈ T : (A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t : tᵢ = 0) ⟹ t is not a valid address)`

  `(A s, t ∈ T : (A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #s : sᵢ = 0) ∧ (E j : 1 ≤ j ≤ #t : tⱼ > 0) ⟹ s < t)`


### Subspace closure

When arithmetic advances a position within one element subspace, the result must remain in that subspace.

An element-local position within subspace `S` has two components: the subspace identifier `N` and the ordinal `x`. A natural first attempt at an element-local displacement is `w = [0, n]` — action point `k = 2`, preserving the subspace identifier and advancing the ordinal. Addition works: `[N, x] ⊕ [0, n] = [N, x + n]`, preserving the subspace. Subtraction: `[N, x] ⊖ [0, n]` finds the first divergence at position 1 (where `N ≠ 0`), not at position 2 where the intended action lies. The subtraction produces `[N - 0, x] = [N, x]` — a no-op.

The operands passed to the arithmetic during shifts are not full element-local positions; they are *within-subspace ordinals* — the second component alone. The subspace identifier is not an operand to the shift; it is structural context that determines which positions are subject to the shift. The arithmetic receives ordinals, not full positions.


## PositiveTumbler — TumblerPositivity

A tumbler `t ∈ T` is *positive*, written `t > 0`, iff at least one of its components is nonzero: `(E i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t : tᵢ ≠ 0)`. A tumbler is a *zero tumbler* iff every component is zero: `(A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t : tᵢ = 0)`.

Every positive tumbler is greater than every zero tumbler under T1 — if `t` has a nonzero component at position `k`, then at position `k` either the zero tumbler has a smaller component (0 < tₖ) or has run out of components, either way placing it below `t`. The condition `w > 0` in TA0 and TA4 excludes all all-zero displacements regardless of length.


## TA7a — Ordinal-only shift arithmetic

The canonical representation for shift arithmetic is the *ordinal-only* formulation: a position in a subspace with identifier `N` and ordinal `o = [o₁, ..., oₘ]` (where `m ≥ 1`) is represented as the tumbler `o` for arithmetic purposes, with `N` held as structural context. Define **S** = {o ∈ T : #o ≥ 1 ∧ (A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #o : oᵢ > 0)} — ordinals with all positive components, matching T4's positive-component constraint on element fields. An element-local displacement is a positive tumbler `w` with action point `k` satisfying `1 ≤ k ≤ m`. In this formulation:

  `(A o ∈ S, w > 0 : k ≤ #o ⟹ o ⊕ w ∈ T)`

  `(A o ∈ S, w > 0 : o ≥ w ⟹ o ⊖ w ∈ T)`

Both operations produce results in T, and the subspace identifier — held as context — is never modified.

For `⊕`, a stronger result holds: components before the action point are preserved positive from `o ∈ S`, and `oₖ + wₖ > 0` since both are positive. When all components of `w` after `k` are also positive, the result is in S. For single-component ordinals (the common case), `[x] ⊕ [n] = [x + n] ∈ S` unconditionally.

The subspace identifier is context — it determines which positions are subject to the shift — not an operand to the arithmetic. Both operations produce genuine shifts in the ordinal-only view; the 2-component view gives a genuine shift for `⊕` but a vacuous closure for `⊖`.

For single-component ordinals, `⊖` gives closure in S ∪ Z: `[x] ⊖ [n]` is `[x - n] ∈ S` when `x > n`, or `[0] ∈ Z` when `x = n` (a sentinel, TA6). When the element field has deeper structure (`δ > 1` in T4), the ordinal `o` has multiple components. A displacement with action point `k ≥ 2` preserves all ordinal components before position `k` — the constructive definition copies `o₁, ..., oₖ₋₁` from the start position unchanged. The subspace closure holds in all cases because the subspace identifier is never an operand.

**Verification of TA7a.** In the ordinal-only formulation, the shift operates on `o = [o₁, ..., oₘ]` with all `oᵢ > 0` (since `o ∈ S`), by displacement `w` with action point `k` satisfying `1 ≤ k ≤ m`.

*For `⊕`:* By the constructive definition, `(o ⊕ w)ᵢ = oᵢ` for `i < k` (positive, preserved from `o`), and `(o ⊕ w)ₖ = oₖ + wₖ > 0` (both positive). Components after `k` come from `w`. The result has length `#w` (by the result-length identity). The result is in T; it is in S when additionally all components of `w` after `k` are positive. The subspace identifier, held as context, is unchanged.

*For `⊖`:* We analyze by action point. When `#w > m`, TumblerSub produces a result of length `max(m, #w) = #w > m` with trailing zeros at positions `m + 1` through `#w` (from the zero-padded minuend); this result lies in T \ S. The S-membership claims below assume the typical case `#w ≤ m`.

*Case `k ≥ 2`:* The displacement has `wᵢ = 0` for `i < k`. Since `o ∈ S`, `o₁ > 0`. The divergence falls at position 1 (where `o₁ > 0 = w₁`). TumblerSub produces: `r₁ = o₁ - 0 = o₁`, and `rᵢ = oᵢ` for `1 < i ≤ m` (copied from the minuend since `i > d = 1`). When `#w ≤ m`, the result has length `m` and equals `o` itself — a no-op; the result is trivially in S.

*Case `k = 1`:* The displacement has `w₁ > 0`. Let `d = divergence(o, w)`. If `d = 1` (i.e., `o₁ ≠ w₁`): since `o ≥ w`, `o₁ > w₁`. TumblerSub yields `r₁ = o₁ - w₁ > 0` and `rᵢ = oᵢ > 0` for `1 < i ≤ m`. When `#w ≤ m`, all components are positive and the result is in S. If `d > 1` (i.e., `o₁ = w₁`, divergence later): TumblerSub zeros positions before `d`, giving `r₁ = 0`. The result has a zero first component and is not in S. Counterexample: `o = [5, 3]`, `w = [5, 1]` (action point `k = 1`, divergence `d = 2`). Result: `[0, 2] ∈ T` but `[0, 2] ∉ S ∪ Z`.

In all cases the subspace identifier, held as context, is never modified. TA7a holds. ∎

The restriction to element-local displacements is necessary. An unrestricted displacement whose action point falls at the subspace-identifier position could produce an address in a different subspace — TA7a cannot hold for arbitrary `w`.


### What tumbler arithmetic is NOT

**The algebra is not a group.** There is no additive identity — the zero tumbler is a sentinel, not a neutral element for addition. There is no additive inverse for every element — subtraction is only defined when `a ≥ w`. The algebra is not closed under subtraction in general.


## TA-assoc — Addition is associative where both compositions are defined

`(a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c)` whenever both sides are well-defined. Three cases exhaust the possibilities. Let `k_b` and `k_c` be the action points of `b` and `c` respectively. When `k_b < k_c`: both sides produce `aᵢ` for `i < k_b`, `aₖ_b + bₖ_b` at `k_b`, `bᵢ` for `k_b < i < k_c`, `bₖ_c + cₖ_c` at `k_c`, and `cᵢ` beyond — identical. When `k_b = k_c = k`: both sides produce `aₖ + bₖ + cₖ` at `k` (natural-number addition is associative) and `cᵢ` beyond — identical. When `k_b > k_c`: both sides produce `aₖ_c + cₖ_c` at `k_c` and `cᵢ` beyond — identical (the deeper displacement `b` is overwritten by the shallower `c` in both cases). The domain conditions are asymmetric — the left side requires `k_b ≤ #a`, while the right requires only `min(k_b, k_c) ≤ #a` — but on the intersection, the values agree.

**Addition is not commutative.** `a ⊕ b = b ⊕ a` does NOT hold in general. The operands play asymmetric roles: the first is a *position*, the second is a *displacement*. The first argument supplies the prefix, the second the suffix — the reverse call gives a different result.

**There is no multiplication or division.** No `tumblermult`, no `tumblerdiv`, no scaling operation of any kind. The arithmetic repertoire is: add, subtract, increment, compare.


### What tumbler arithmetic is NOT

**The algebra is not a group.** There is no additive identity — the zero tumbler is a sentinel, not a neutral element for addition. There is no additive inverse for every element — subtraction is only defined when `a ≥ w`. The algebra is not closed under subtraction in general.


### Spans

A span is a pair `(s, ℓ)` where `s ∈ T` is a start address and `ℓ ∈ T` is a length (a positive tumbler used as a displacement), denoting the contiguous range from `s` up to but not including `s ⊕ ℓ`. The form of `ℓ` depends on the hierarchical level at which the span operates, because the action point of `ℓ` must match the level of the start address `s`.

A span whose start is a high-level prefix and whose length reaches to the next sibling captures exactly that subtree's content. A span may be empty — populated by nothing at present — yet valid. The range is determined by the endpoints; what is actually stored within that range is a question about the current state of the system, not about the tumbler algebra.

## TA-LC — LeftCancellation

If a ⊕ x = a ⊕ y with both sides well-defined (TA0 satisfied for both), then x = y.

*Proof.* Let k₁ and k₂ be the action points of x and y. If k₁ < k₂, then (a ⊕ x)_{k₁} = a_{k₁} + x_{k₁} while (a ⊕ y)_{k₁} = a_{k₁} (position k₁ falls in the "copy from start" range of y). Equality gives x_{k₁} = 0, contradicting k₁ being the action point of x. Symmetrically k₂ < k₁ is impossible. So k₁ = k₂ = k.

At position k: a_k + x_k = a_k + y_k gives x_k = y_k. For i > k: x_i = (a ⊕ x)_i = (a ⊕ y)_i = y_i. For i < k: x_i = 0 = y_i. It remains to establish #x = #y. By T3, a ⊕ x = a ⊕ y implies #(a ⊕ x) = #(a ⊕ y). From TumblerAdd's result-length formula, #(a ⊕ w) = max(k − 1, 0) + (#w − k + 1) for any w with action point k. Since both x and y share the same action point k, we get #x = #y. By T3 (same length, same components), x = y.  ∎


## TA-RC — Right cancellation fails

There exist tumblers a, b, w with a ≠ b and a ⊕ w = b ⊕ w (both sides well-defined).

*Proof by example.* Let a = [1, 3, 5], b = [1, 3, 7], and w = [0, 2, 4] (action point k = 2). Then:

  a ⊕ w = [1, 3 + 2, 4] = [1, 5, 4]
  b ⊕ w = [1, 3 + 2, 4] = [1, 5, 4]  (component 3 of b is discarded — tail replacement)

So a ⊕ w = b ⊕ w = [1, 5, 4] despite a ≠ b — the difference at position 3 is erased by tail replacement.  ∎


## TA-MTO — ManyToOneEquivalence

For any displacement w with action point k and any tumblers a, b with #a ≥ k and #b ≥ k: a ⊕ w = b ⊕ w if and only if a_i = b_i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k.

*Proof (forward).* Assume a_i = b_i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k. From TumblerAdd's definition: for i < k, (a ⊕ w)_i = a_i = b_i = (b ⊕ w)_i. At i = k, (a ⊕ w)_k = a_k + w_k = b_k + w_k = (b ⊕ w)_k. For i > k, (a ⊕ w)_i = w_i = (b ⊕ w)_i. The results have the same length (max(k − 1, 0) + (#w − k + 1) depends only on k and #w). By T3, a ⊕ w = b ⊕ w.  ∎

*Proof (converse).* Suppose a ⊕ w = b ⊕ w. Let k be the action point of w. We must show a_i = b_i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k.

(a) For i < k: position i falls in the "copy from start" region of TumblerAdd, so (a ⊕ w)_i = a_i and (b ⊕ w)_i = b_i. From a ⊕ w = b ⊕ w we get a_i = b_i.

(b) At i = k: (a ⊕ w)_k = a_k + w_k and (b ⊕ w)_k = b_k + w_k. Equality gives a_k + w_k = b_k + w_k, hence a_k = b_k by cancellation in ℕ.

Components after k are unconstrained: for i > k, (a ⊕ w)_i = w_i = (b ⊕ w)_i regardless of a_i and b_i.  ∎


## D0 — Displacement well-definedness

b ⊖ a is well-defined when: a < b and divergence(a, b) ≤ #a.

These conditions ensure the displacement is a positive tumbler with action point k ≤ #a, so TA0 is satisfied for a ⊕ (b ⊖ a). Round-trip faithfulness (D1) additionally requires #a ≤ #b: the displacement w = b ⊖ a has length max(#a, #b), and the result a ⊕ w has length #w; when #a > #b, #w = #a > #b, so the result cannot equal b by T3.

When divergence(a, b) = #a + 1 (a is a proper prefix of b), D0 is not satisfied — no valid displacement exists.


## D1 — Displacement round-trip

For tumblers a, b ∈ T with a < b, divergence(a, b) ≤ #a, and #a ≤ #b:

  a ⊕ (b ⊖ a) = b

*Proof.* Let k = divergence(a, b). By hypothesis k ≤ #a ≤ #b, so this is type (i) divergence with aₖ < bₖ. Define w = b ⊖ a by TumblerSub: wᵢ = 0 for i < k, wₖ = bₖ − aₖ, wᵢ = bᵢ for i > k. The result has length max(#a, #b) = #b. Now w > 0 since wₖ > 0, and the action point of w is k ≤ #a, so TA0 is satisfied. Applying TumblerAdd: (a ⊕ w)ᵢ = aᵢ = bᵢ for i < k (before divergence), (a ⊕ w)ₖ = aₖ + (bₖ − aₖ) = bₖ, and (a ⊕ w)ᵢ = wᵢ = bᵢ for i > k. The result has length #w = #b; every component matches b, so a ⊕ w = b by T3.  ∎

## D2 — Displacement uniqueness

Under D1's preconditions (a < b, divergence(a, b) ≤ #a, #a ≤ #b), if a ⊕ w = b then w = b ⊖ a.

*Proof.* By D1, a ⊕ (b ⊖ a) = b. So a ⊕ w = a ⊕ (b ⊖ a), and by TA-LC, w = b ⊖ a.  ∎

### Ordinal displacement and shift


## OrdinalDisplacement — ActionPointDisplacementTumbler (DEFINITION, function)

For natural number n ≥ 1 and depth m ≥ 1, the *ordinal displacement* δ(n, m) is the tumbler [0, 0, ..., 0, n] of length m — zero at positions 1 through m − 1, and n at position m. Its action point is m.

When the depth is determined by context (typically m = #v for the tumbler being shifted), we write δₙ.


## OrdinalShift — TumblerDepthShift (DEFINITION, function)

For a tumbler v of length m and natural number n ≥ 1:

`shift(v, n) = v ⊕ δ(n, m)`

TA0 is satisfied: the action point of δ(n, m) is m = #v, so k ≤ #v holds trivially. By TumblerAdd: shift(v, n)ᵢ = vᵢ for i < m, and shift(v, n)ₘ = vₘ + n.

#shift(v, n) = #δₙ = m = #v by the result-length identity of TumblerAdd. When m ≥ 2: shift(v, n)₁ = v₁. When m = 1: shift([S], n) = [S + n]. Since n ≥ 1: shift(v, n)ₘ = vₘ + n ≥ 1 for all vₘ ≥ 0.


## TS1 — ShiftStrictMonotonicity

`(A v₁, v₂, n : n ≥ 1 ∧ #v₁ = #v₂ = m ∧ v₁ < v₂ : shift(v₁, n) < shift(v₂, n))`

*Derivation.* Fix n ≥ 1. Since #v₁ = #v₂ = m and v₁ ≠ v₂, the divergence point satisfies divergence(v₁, v₂) ≤ m. The action point of δₙ is m ≥ divergence(v₁, v₂). By TA1-strict: v₁ ⊕ δₙ < v₂ ⊕ δₙ. ∎


## TS2 — ShiftInjectivity

`(A v₁, v₂, n : n ≥ 1 ∧ #v₁ = #v₂ = m : shift(v₁, n) = shift(v₂, n) ⟹ v₁ = v₂)`

*Derivation.* Fix n ≥ 1. By TA-MTO: v₁ ⊕ δₙ = v₂ ⊕ δₙ iff (A i : 1 ≤ i ≤ m : v₁ᵢ = v₂ᵢ). The action point of δₙ is m, and agreement at positions 1..m for tumblers of length m means v₁ = v₂ by T3 (CanonicalRepresentation). ∎

## TS3 — ShiftAdditivity

`(A v, n₁, n₂ : n₁ ≥ 1 ∧ n₂ ≥ 1 ∧ #v = m : shift(shift(v, n₁), n₂) = shift(v, n₁ + n₂))`

*Derivation.* We expand both sides component-wise using TumblerAdd's constructive definition.

Left side: let u = shift(v, n₁) = v ⊕ δ(n₁, m). By TumblerAdd, uᵢ = vᵢ for i < m, uₘ = vₘ + n₁, and #u = m. Now shift(u, n₂) = u ⊕ δ(n₂, m). By TumblerAdd, the result has components uᵢ = vᵢ for i < m, and uₘ + n₂ = vₘ + n₁ + n₂ at position m. Length is m.

Right side: shift(v, n₁ + n₂) = v ⊕ δ(n₁ + n₂, m). By TumblerAdd, components are vᵢ for i < m, and vₘ + (n₁ + n₂) at position m. Length is m.

Both sides have length m and agree at every component (natural-number addition is associative: vₘ + n₁ + n₂ = vₘ + (n₁ + n₂)). By T3: they are equal. ∎


## TS4 — ShiftStrictIncrease

`(A v, n : n ≥ 1 ∧ #v = m : shift(v, n) > v)`

*Derivation.* δ(n, m) > 0 since its m-th component is n ≥ 1. By TA-strict: v ⊕ δ(n, m) > v. ∎


## TS5 — ShiftStrictMonotonicity

`(A v, n₁, n₂ : n₁ ≥ 1 ∧ n₂ > n₁ ∧ #v = m : shift(v, n₁) < shift(v, n₂))`

*Derivation.* Write n₂ = n₁ + (n₂ − n₁) where n₂ − n₁ ≥ 1. By TS3: shift(v, n₂) = shift(shift(v, n₁), n₂ − n₁). By TS4: shift(shift(v, n₁), n₂ − n₁) > shift(v, n₁). ∎

### Increment for allocation

We define the *last significant position* of a tumbler `t`. When `t` has at least one nonzero component, `sig(t) = max({i : 1 ≤ i ≤ #t ∧ tᵢ ≠ 0})` — the position of the last nonzero component. When every component is zero, `sig(t) = #t`.

For valid addresses, `sig(t)` falls within the last populated field. This is a consequence of T4's positive-component constraint: every field component is strictly positive, so the last component of the last field is nonzero, and `sig(t) = #t`. Therefore `inc(t, 0)` on a valid address increments the last component of the last field, modifying only within that field and preserving the hierarchical structure.
