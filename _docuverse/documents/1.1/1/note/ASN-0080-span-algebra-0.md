# ASN-0080: Span Algebra 0

*2026-04-09*

This ASN extends ASN-0053 (Span Algebra) with the post-insertion shift property: the guarantee that ordinal shift applied uniformly to arrangement positions at or beyond an insertion point preserves mapping values while relocating V-positions forward by a fixed displacement. The ordinal shift — defined by OrdinalShift and OrdinalDisplacement (ASN-0034) — is a fundamental operation on the tumbler line whose interaction with arrangement mappings determines how contiguous regions of mapped positions are repositioned without altering the content they reference. The property belongs in the span algebra domain because it characterizes how the displacement arithmetic underlying span endpoints (reach(σ) = start(σ) ⊕ width(σ)) behaves when applied as a uniform translation to a region of a partial function over the tumbler line.


## The Ordinal Shift

The *ordinal displacement* δ(n, m) is defined in the foundation: for n ≥ 1 and m ≥ 1, δ(n, m) = [0, 0, ..., 0, n] of length m — zero at positions 1 through m − 1, and n at position m, with action point m (OrdinalDisplacement, ASN-0034).

When the depth is determined by context (typically m = #p for insertion position p), we write δₙ.

The *ordinal shift* is defined in the foundation: for a V-position v of depth m and n ≥ 1, shift(v, n) = v ⊕ δ(n, m) (OrdinalShift, ASN-0034). By TumblerAdd: shift(v, n)ᵢ = vᵢ for i < m, and shift(v, n)ₘ = vₘ + n. The shift advances the ordinal within the V-position's subspace by exactly n, leaving all higher-level components unchanged.

We need two properties of this shift. Both are established in the foundation.

Order preservation is guaranteed: for v₁, v₂ with #v₁ = #v₂ = m and v₁ < v₂, shift(v₁, n) < shift(v₂, n) (TS1, ASN-0034).

The relative ordering of content is preserved through the shift. What was before other content remains before it after insertion — Nelson's guarantee that content appears "in its original relative order on either side" (Q2).

Injectivity is likewise guaranteed: for v₁, v₂ with #v₁ = #v₂ = m, shift(v₁, n) = shift(v₂, n) implies v₁ = v₂ (TS2, ASN-0034).

Injectivity ensures the shift creates no collisions: distinct V-positions remain distinct after shifting.

Additionally, shift preserves structural properties. Subspace preservation requires m ≥ 2: ordinal increment via TA5(c) modifies position m = #v, so when m ≥ 2 the action point of δₙ leaves position 1 unchanged — shift(v, n)₁ = v₁ — giving subspace(shift(v, n)) = subspace(v). When m = 1, shift([S], n) = [S + n] changes the subspace identifier; we exclude this by requiring #p ≥ 2 as an operation precondition. By S8-depth, all V-positions in the subspace share p's depth, so m ≥ 2 holds throughout. Furthermore, #shift(v, n) = #δₙ = m = #v by the result-length identity of TumblerAdd. So the shift preserves subspace membership, tumbler depth, and — since vₘ + n > 0 whenever vₘ ≥ 1 — the positivity required by S8a.


## Post-Insertion Shift

We work with the system state Σ = (C, E, M, R) of ASN-0047. M is the arrangement function with M(d) : T ⇀ T for each document d. An operation that places n ≥ 1 new content elements at position p in document d within subspace S = subspace(p) = p₁ (the text subspace, with S ≥ 1 per S8a) modifies M(d) to produce M'(d).

**I3** — *PostInsertionShift* (POSTCONDITION, introduced). Content at or beyond p shifts forward by n ordinal positions:

`(A v : v ∈ dom(M(d)) ∧ subspace(v) = S ∧ v ≥ p : shift(v, n) ∈ dom(M'(d)) ∧ M'(d)(shift(v, n)) = M(d)(v))`

The I-address is unchanged — only the V-position moves. This is Nelson's central guarantee (Q1, Q5): the permanent identity of every existing byte is invariant under insertion. "Since the links are to the bytes themselves, any links to those bytes remain stably attached to them" [LM 4/30]. The shift moves content in the document's arrangement without touching the content's identity in the store.


### Worked Example

Consider document d with five characters at V-positions [1, 1] through [1, 5], mapped to contiguous I-addresses b, b + 1, ..., b + 4.

Insert two characters at p = [1, 3]. Parameters: n = 2, S = 1, m = 2, δ₂ = [0, 2].

I3 shifts: shift([1, 3], 2) = [1, 3] ⊕ [0, 2] = [1, 5], shift([1, 4], 2) = [1, 6], shift([1, 5], 2) = [1, 7]. Each shifted position preserves its I-address:

| V (before) | I (before) | V (after) | I (after) |
|---|---|---|---|
| [1, 3] | b + 2 | [1, 5] | b + 2 |
| [1, 4] | b + 3 | [1, 6] | b + 3 |
| [1, 5] | b + 4 | [1, 7] | b + 4 |

The three V-positions at or beyond p = [1, 3] are each advanced by δ₂ = [0, 2]; their I-addresses b + 2, b + 3, b + 4 are unchanged. ∎

## Open Questions

- When external state records a V-position, what must the system provide to allow that reference to be updated after a shift repositions it?
