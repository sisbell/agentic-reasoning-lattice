**S7b (Element-level I-addresses).** We require that every address in `dom(Σ.C)` is an element-level tumbler: `(A a ∈ dom(Σ.C) :: zeros(a) = 3)`.

By T4's field correspondence, `zeros(a) = 3` means all four identifying fields — node, user, document, element — are present, and the element field contains the content-level address.

*Formal Contract (S7b):*
- *Axiom (design requirement):* `(A a ∈ dom(Σ.C) :: zeros(a) = 3)`.
- *Postconditions:* By T4's field correspondence, all four identifying fields — node, user, document, element — are present and the element field exists. The projections `N(a)`, `U(a)`, `D(a)`, `E(a)` supplied by T4b are all well-defined.
- *Depends:* T4 (HierarchicalParsing, ASN-0034) — field correspondence; T4b (UniqueParse, ASN-0034) — projection definitions; T10a.4 (T4PreservationUnderDiscipline, ASN-0034) — T4-validity (no adjacent zeros, `a₁ ≠ 0 ∧ a_{#a} ≠ 0`) and the bound `zeros(a) ≤ 3`.
