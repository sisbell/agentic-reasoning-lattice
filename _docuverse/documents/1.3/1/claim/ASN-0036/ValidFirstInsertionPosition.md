**ValidFirstInsertionPosition (ValidFirstInsertionPosition).** For a document `d` with `V_1(d) = ∅`, the *ternary* predicate `ValidFirstInsertionPosition(d, v, m)` is satisfied when `m ∈ ℕ` with `m ≥ 2` and `v = [1, 1, ..., 1]` of depth `m`.

### Valid insertion position examples

**Non-empty case (binary predicate).** Let subspace S = 1 and suppose V₁(d) = {[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]}, so N = 3 and min(V₁(d)) = [1, 1]. The depth `m = 2` is read from state via S8-depth. The values of `v` satisfying `ValidInsertionPosition(d, v)` are:

- j = 0: v = min(V₁(d)) = [1, 1]
- j = 1: v = shift([1, 1], 1) = [1, 2]
- j = 2: v = shift([1, 1], 2) = [1, 3]
- j = 3: v = shift([1, 1], 3) = [1, 4]

That gives N + 1 = 4 positions. Any successor state whose `V₁(d)` gains a position at, say, [1, 2] must still satisfy D-CTG and D-MIN.

**Empty case (ternary predicate).** V₁(d) = ∅. Choosing depth m = 2, the unique `v` satisfying `ValidFirstInsertionPosition(d, v, 2)` is `[1, 1]`. D-MIN requires min(V₁(d)) = [1, 1] once the subspace becomes non-empty, so the position is exactly the one D-MIN demands. Choosing m = 3 instead, `ValidFirstInsertionPosition(d, v, 3)` is satisfied uniquely by `v = [1, 1, 1]`; by T3, this is a different tumbler.
