**D-MIN (VMinimumPosition).** For each document d with V_1(d) non-empty:

`min(V_1(d)) = [1, 1, ..., 1]`

where the tuple has length m (the common depth of V-positions in the text subspace per S8-depth), and every component is 1.

At depth 2 this gives min(V_1(d)) = [1, 1].

*Formal Contract:*
- *Axiom (design requirement):* `V_1(d) ≠ ∅ ⟹ min(V_1(d)) = [1, 1, ..., 1]` of length `m_1` (the common depth per S8-depth).
- *Preconditions:* V_1(d) non-empty; common depth `m_1` (S8-depth) with `m_1 ≥ 2` (S8a).
- *Postconditions:* Every component of `min(V_1(d))` equals 1; in particular the text subspace identifier `min(V_1(d))₁ = 1` and the within-subspace ordinal starts at the minimum positive value.
- *Depends:* S8a, S8-depth, T1 (LexicographicOrder, ASN-0034) — defines `min`.

We now derive the general form: the contiguity, minimum, and finiteness constraints together force V_1(d) into a single block of last-component values. The proof below establishes this in four steps.
