**S(p,d) (SiblingStream).** We call the sequence c₁, c₂, c₃, ... the *sibling stream* of p at depth d, written S(p, d). By TA5(c), each sibling increment preserves the tumbler's length and advances only the last significant component by 1. Every element of S(p, d) has the form [p₁, ..., p_{#p}, 0, ..., 0, n] — the parent's components, then d − 1 zeros, then the ordinal n. The stream is strictly increasing:

*Proof.* We must show that every element cₙ of S(p, d) has the form [p₁, ..., p_{#p}, 0, ..., 0, n] — the parent's first #p components, then d − 1 zeros, then ordinal n — with uniform length #cₙ = #p + d. The argument proceeds by induction on n.

*Base case (n = 1).* c₁ = inc(p, d) with d ≥ 1. By TA5(d) (ASN-0034), c₁ has length #p + d: the first #p components are preserved from p (TA5(b)), the next d − 1 positions #p + 1 through #p + d − 1 are zero-valued field separators, and the final position #p + d has value 1. This is exactly [p₁, ..., p_{#p}, 0, ..., 0, 1] with d − 1 zeros and ordinal 1.

*Inductive step.* Assume cₙ = [p₁, ..., p_{#p}, 0, ..., 0, n] with d − 1 zeros and #cₙ = #p + d for some n ≥ 1. Since n ≥ 1, position #p + d holds value n > 0, so sig(cₙ) = #p + d — the ordinal position is the last significant component. Consider cₙ₊₁ = inc(cₙ, 0). By TA5(c), cₙ₊₁ has the same length as cₙ (#cₙ₊₁ = #p + d) and differs from cₙ only at position sig(cₙ) = #p + d, where cₙ₊₁ at that position equals n + 1. All other positions are unchanged: the first #p components remain p₁, ..., p_{#p} (since every position i ≤ #p satisfies i < sig(cₙ) = #p + d), and the d − 1 zeros at positions #p + 1 through #p + d − 1 remain zero (since each such position j satisfies j < #p + d = sig(cₙ)). Therefore cₙ₊₁ = [p₁, ..., p_{#p}, 0, ..., 0, n + 1], the claimed form with ordinal n + 1. ∎
